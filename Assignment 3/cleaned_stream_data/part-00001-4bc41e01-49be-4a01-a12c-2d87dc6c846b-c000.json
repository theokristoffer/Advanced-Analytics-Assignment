In this\npaper, we propose a dual-stream neural framework designed to generate\nsynchronized hand gestures for piano playing from audio input, addressing the\ncritical challenge of modeling both hand independence and coordination. Our\nframework introduces two key innovations: (i) a decoupled diffusion-based\ngeneration framework that independently models each hand's motion via\ndual-noise initialization, sampling distinct latent noise for each while\nleveraging a shared positional condition, and (ii) a Hand-Coordinated\nAsymmetric Attention (HCAA) mechanism suppresses symmetric (common-mode) noise\nto highlight asymmetric hand-specific features, while adaptively enhancing\ninter-hand coordination during denoising. The system operates hierarchically:\nit first predicts 3D hand positions from audio features and then generates\njoint angles through position-aware diffusion models, where parallel denoising\nstreams interact via HCAA. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our\nframework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple\nmetrics.","main_category":"cs.SD","categories":"cs.SD,cs.CV,eess.AS","published":"2025-04-14T05:17:41Z"}

Memes are typically humorous and harmless, however there are also memes\nthat promote hate speech, being in this way harmful to individuals and groups\nbased on their identity. Therefore, detecting hateful content in memes has\nemerged as a task of critical importance. The need for understanding the\ncomplex interactions of images and their embedded text renders the hateful meme\ndetection a challenging multimodal task. In this paper we propose to address\nthe aforementioned task leveraging knowledge encoded in powerful Large\nMultimodal Models (LMM). Specifically, we propose to exploit LMMs in a two-fold\nmanner. First, by extracting knowledge oriented to the hateful meme detection\ntask in order to build strong meme representations. Specifically, generic\nsemantic descriptions and emotions that the images along with their embedded\ntexts elicit are extracted, which are then used to train a simple\nclassification head for hateful meme detection. Second, by developing a novel\nhard mining approach introducing directly LMM-encoded knowledge to the training\nprocess, providing further improvements.

Prior works leverage\npre-trained CLIP to extract person visual and textual features and fully\nfine-tune the entire network, which have shown notable performance improvements\ncompared to uni-modal pre-training models. However, full-tuning a large model\nis prone to overfitting and hinders the generalization ability. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel Unified Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) method\nfor Text-based Person Retrieval (UP-Person) to thoroughly transfer the\nmulti-modal knowledge from CLIP. Specifically, UP-Person simultaneously\nintegrates three lightweight PETL components including Prefix, LoRA and\nAdapter, where Prefix and LoRA are devised together to mine local information\nwith task-specific information prompts, and Adapter is designed to adjust\nglobal feature representations. Additionally, two vanilla submodules are\noptimized to adapt to the unified architecture of TPR. For one thing, S-Prefix\nis proposed to boost attention of prefix and enhance the gradient propagation\nof prefix tokens, which improves the flexibility and performance of the vanilla\nprefix. For another thing, L-Adapter is designed in parallel with layer\nnormalization to adjust the overall distribution, which can resolve conflicts\ncaused by overlap and interaction among multiple submodules. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that our UP-Person achieves state-of-the-art\nresults across various person retrieval datasets, including CUHK-PEDES,\nICFG-PEDES and RSTPReid while merely fine-tuning 4.7\\% parameters.

Current deep learning-based MOD methods rely on probability\ndensity estimation, which restricts flexible information interaction between\nobjects and across temporal frames. To flexibly capture high-order inter-object\nand temporal relationships, we propose a point-based MOD in remote sensing.\nInspired by diffusion models, the network optimization is formulated as a\nprogressive denoising process that iteratively recovers moving object centers\nfrom sparse noisy points. Specifically, we sample scattered features from the\nbackbone outputs as atomic units for subsequent processing, while global\nfeature embeddings are aggregated to compensate for the limited coverage of\nsparse point features. By modeling spatial relative positions and semantic\naffinities, Spatial Relation Aggregation Attention is designed to enable\nhigh-order interactions among point-level features for enhanced object\nrepresentation. To enhance temporal consistency, the Temporal Propagation and\nGlobal Fusion module is designed, which leverages an implicit memory reasoning\nmechanism for robust cross-frame feature integration. To align with the\nprogressive denoising process, we propose a progressive MinK optimal transport\nassignment strategy that establishes specialized learning objectives at each\ndenoising level. Additionally, we introduce a missing loss function to\ncounteract the clustering tendency of denoised points around salient objects.\nExperiments on the RsData remote sensing MOD dataset show that our MOD method\nbased on scattered point denoising can more effectively explore potential\nrelationships between sparse moving objects and improve the detection\ncapability and temporal consistency.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,I.4.8","published":"2025-04-14T14:44:52Z"}

The engine operates in a space-dependent confining potential\nand requires an appropriate feedback control mechanism. In general, the\nfeedback controller has three different steps: measurement, feedback, and\nrelaxation. The feedback step is related to a sudden change in the potential\nenergy that is essential for a nonzero work output. BIE utilises the amount of\ninformation (surprise) acquired during the measurement step for the energy\noutput. However, due to the relaxation process, a certain amount of acquired\ninformation is lost or becomes unavailable. So, controlling information loss\nduring relaxation is crucial for the overall efficiency of the engine. The net\n(available) information, therefore, can be monitored by tuning the feedback\ncontroller and the shape of the confining potential. In this paper, we explore\nthe effect of the shape modulation of the confining potential, which may have\nmultiple stable valleys and unstable hills, on the net available information\nand, hence, the performance of a BIE that operates under an asymmetric feedback\nprotocol. We examine the optimal performance requirements of the BIE and the\namount of maximum work output under different potential profiling.

Given an (m+n)-mode Gaussian state G, we express it as an (m+n)-mode\n\"Gaussian core state\" G_core followed by a fixed m-mode Gaussian transformation\nT that only acts on the first m modes. The defining property of the Gaussian\ncore state G_core is that measuring the last n of its modes in the\nphoton-number basis leaves the first m modes on a finite Fock support, i.e. a\ncore state. Since T is measurement-independent and G_core has an exact and\nfinite Fock representation, this decomposition exactly describes all\nnon-Gaussian states obtainable by projecting n modes of G onto the Fock basis.\nFor pure states we prove that a physical pair (G_core, T) always exists with\nG_core pure and T unitary.

While SLN\nanalysis has recently garnered attention, most existing approaches rely on\ncentralized training, where data is aggregated and processed on a local/cloud\nserver with direct access to raw data. However, in real-world educational\nsettings, such direct access across multiple classrooms is often restricted due\nto privacy concerns. Furthermore, training models on isolated classroom data\nprevents the identification of common interaction patterns that exist across\nmultiple classrooms, thereby limiting model performance. To address these\nchallenges, we propose one of the first frameworks that integrates Federated\nLearning (FL), a distributed and collaborative machine learning (ML) paradigm,\nwith SLNs derived from students' interactions in multiple classrooms' online\nforums to predict future link formations (i.e., interactions) among students.\nBy leveraging FL, our approach enables collaborative model training across\nmultiple classrooms while preserving data privacy, as it eliminates the need\nfor raw data centralization. Recognizing that each classroom may exhibit unique\nstudent interaction dynamics, we further employ model personalization\ntechniques to adapt the FL model to individual classroom characteristics.

While some\nstudies report absence of the X-ray shallow decay for hyper-energetic GRBs,\nrecently discovered GRB 240529A shows a clear shallow decay phase with an\nisotropic gamma-ray energy of \\SI{2.2e54}{erg}, making it a highly unusual case\ncompared to typical GRBs. In order to investigate the physical mechanism of the\nshallow decay, we perform the \\textit{Fermi}-LAT analysis of GRB 240529A along\nwith \\textit{Swift}-XRT analysis. We find no jet break feature in the X-ray\nlight curve and then give the lower bound of the collimation-corrected jet\nenergy of $>10^{52}$~erg, which is close to the maximum rotational energy of a\nmagnetar. Our LAT data analysis reveals evidence of GeV emission with a\nstatistical significance of $4.5\\sigma$ during the shallow decay phase, which\ncan be interpreted as the first case for hyper-energetic GRBs with a typical\nshallow decay phase. The GeV to keV flux ratio is calculated to be $4.2\\pm2.3$.\nTogether with X-ray spectral index, this indicates an inverse Compton origin of\nthe GeV emission.

In\nreal-world settings, the formation of communities is often impacted by several\nsocial factors, such as ethnicity, gender, wealth, or other attributes. These\nfactors may introduce structural inequalities; for instance, real-world\nnetworks can have a few majority groups and many minority groups. Community\ndetection algorithms, which identify communities based on network topology, may\ngenerate unfair outcomes if they fail to account for existing structural\ninequalities, particularly affecting underrepresented groups. In this work, we\npropose a set of novel group fairness metrics to assess the fairness of\ncommunity detection methods. Additionally, we conduct a comparative evaluation\nof the most common community detection methods, analyzing the trade-off between\nperformance and fairness.

To handle these issues, we propose the\never-scalingness for building the benchmarks which are uncrushable, unhackable,\nauto-verifiable and general. This paper presents Nondeterministic\nPolynomial-time Problem Challenge (NPPC), an ever-scaling reasoning benchmark\nfor LLMs. Specifically, the NPPC has three main modules: i) npgym, which\nprovides a unified interface of 25 well-known NP-complete problems and can\ngenerate any number of instances with any levels of complexities, ii) npsolver:\nwhich provides a unified interface to evaluate the problem instances with both\nonline and offline models via APIs and local deployments, respectively, and\niii) npeval: which provides the comprehensive and ready-to-use tools to analyze\nthe performances of LLMs over different problems, the number of tokens, the aha\nmoments, the reasoning errors and the solution errors. Extensive experiments\nover widely-used LLMs demonstrate: i) NPPC can successfully decrease the\nperformances of advanced LLMs' performances to below 10%, demonstrating that\nNPPC is uncrushable, ii) DeepSeek-R1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and o1/o3-mini are the\nmost powerful LLMs, where DeepSeek-R1 outperforms Claude-3.7-Sonnet and\no1/o3-mini in most NP-complete problems considered, and iii) the numbers of\ntokens, aha moments in the advanced LLMs, e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet and\nDeepSeek-R1, are observed first to increase and then decrease when the problem\ninstances become more and more difficult. We believe that NPPC is the first\never-scaling reasoning benchmark, serving as the uncrushable and unhackable\ntestbed for LLMs toward artificial general intelligence (AGI).","main_category":"cs.AI","categories":"cs.AI,cs.CL","published":"2025-04-15T14:40:29Z"}

It does so by perceiving and interpreting the graphical user\ninterfaces (GUIs) of relevant apps, often visually, inferring necessary\nsequences of actions, and then interacting with GUIs by executing the actions\nsuch as clicking, typing, and tapping. To complete real-world tasks, such as\nfilling forms or booking services, GUI agents often need to process and act on\nsensitive user data.

Moreover, they usually ignore\nthe reliability of the restoration results, which is much more urgent in\nmedical systems. To alleviate these issues, we present LRformer, a Lightweight\nTransformer-based method via Reliability-guided learning in the frequency\ndomain. Specifically, inspired by the uncertainty quantification in Bayesian\nneural networks (BNNs), we develop a Reliable Lesion-Semantic Prior Producer\n(RLPP). RLPP leverages Monte Carlo (MC) estimators with stochastic sampling\noperations to generate sufficiently-reliable priors by performing multiple\ninferences on the foundational medical image segmentation model, MedSAM.\nAdditionally, instead of directly incorporating the priors in the spatial\ndomain, we decompose the cross-attention (CA) mechanism into real symmetric and\nimaginary anti-symmetric parts via fast Fourier transform (FFT), resulting in\nthe design of the Guided Frequency Cross-Attention (GFCA) solver. By leveraging\nthe conjugated symmetric property of FFT, GFCA reduces the computational\ncomplexity of naive CA by nearly half.

Videos of human-object interactions are easier to collect\nand scale, but leveraging them directly for robot learning is difficult due to\nthe lack of explicit action labels from videos and morphological differences\nbetween robot and human hands. We propose Human2Sim2Robot, a novel\nreal-to-sim-to-real framework for training dexterous manipulation policies\nusing only one RGB-D video of a human demonstrating a task. Our method utilizes\nreinforcement learning (RL) in simulation to cross the human-robot embodiment\ngap without relying on wearables, teleoperation, or large-scale data collection\ntypically necessary for imitation learning methods. From the demonstration, we\nextract two task-specific components: (1) the object pose trajectory to define\nan object-centric, embodiment-agnostic reward function, and (2) the\npre-manipulation hand pose to initialize and guide exploration during RL\ntraining. We found that these two components are highly effective for learning\nthe desired task, eliminating the need for task-specific reward shaping and\ntuning. We demonstrate that Human2Sim2Robot outperforms object-aware open-loop\ntrajectory replay by 55% and imitation learning with data augmentation by 68%\nacross grasping, non-prehensile manipulation, and multi-step tasks.

Interestingly, this thermality is independent of shift\nparameter as long as it is non-zero and therefore arises even if the shift\nparameter is as small as Planck length. Building on this insight, we propose a\nset-up involving two atoms accelerating with identical acceleration.

Remarkably again, this\nentanglement, like the perceived thermality, is independent of the shift\nparameter, provided it is non-vanishing.

In both type-I and\ntype-II cones, the energy dispersion is linear in all momentum directions.\nType-I cones are characterized by a non-overtilted structure, where the Dirac\npoint serves as a local minimum (maximum) for the upper (lower) band. In\ncontrast, type-II cones exhibit overtilted dispersions, leading to the\ncoexistence of electron and hole pockets. At the critical tilt, the linear\nenergy dispersion vanishes in one momentum direction, corresponding to a\ntype-III Dirac cone. We further define a special case, termed the\n\"narrow-sense\" type-III cone, where not only the linear term but also quadratic\nand higher-order terms vanish, resulting in a completely flat dispersion along\none direction. In this work, we numerically investigate the temperature ($T$)\n-dependence of the electronic specific heat ($C$), as the Dirac cone is\ncontinuously tilted from type-I to narrow-sense type-III. A model with\nparticle-hole symmetry is employed to ensure that the chemical potential\n($\\mu$) remains temperature independent.

Nevertheless, model-based\napproaches must account for the complexities of the imaging chain to maintain\nhigh image quality. A recently proposed direct reconstruction method leverages\nweighted Chebyshev polynomials in the frequency domain, removing the need for a\nsimulated system matrix. However, the underlying model neglects key physical\neffects, such as nanoparticle anisotropy, leading to distortions in\nreconstructed images. To mitigate these artifacts, an adapted direct Chebyshev\nreconstruction (DCR) method incorporates a spatially variant deconvolution\nstep, significantly improving reconstruction accuracy at the cost of increased\ncomputational demands. In this work, we evaluate the adapted DCR on six\nexperimental phantoms, demonstrating enhanced reconstruction quality in real\nmeasurements and achieving image fidelity comparable to or exceeding that of\nsimulated system matrix reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient\napproximation for the spatially variable deconvolution, reducing both runtime\nand memory consumption while maintaining accuracy. This method achieves\ncomputational complexity of O(N log N ), making it particularly beneficial for\nhigh-resolution and three-dimensional imaging. Our results highlight the\npotential of the adapted DCR approach for improving model-based MPI\nreconstruction in practical applications.","main_category":"physics.med-ph","categories":"physics.med-ph,cs.NA,eess.IV,math.NA","published":"2025-04-17T14:37:49Z"}

First predicted in 1998, electronic nematicity has been established\nin a variety of materials, including two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) in\nmagnetic fields, copper-oxide superconductors, and Fe-based superconductors. A\nlong-standing open question is what physical mechanisms drive electronic\nnematic order. In BaFe$_2$As$_2$ and highly underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+y}$,\nstrong evidence suggests that nematicity arises from vestigial\nspin-density-wave (SDW) order. However, evidence for nematicity associated with\ncharge-density-wave (CDW) order has been less conclusive, particularly in\nsystems near a superconducting state. Here, we present direct evidence for\nCDW-driven nematic fluctuations in the pnictide superconductor\nBa$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$Ni$_2$As$_2$ (BSNA), a Ni-based homologue of Fe-based\nsuperconductors that exhibits CDW rather than SDW order.

Using x-ray\nscattering under uniaxial strain, we demonstrate that even minimal strain\nlevels ($\\epsilon \\sim 10^{-4}$) significantly break the fourfold symmetry of\nthe CDW. Within a Ginzburg-Landau framework, we define a nematic susceptibility\nbased on the asymmetric response of symmetry-related CDW superlattice\nreflections, showing strong agreement with elastoresistivity measurements.

This has led to the development of predictive cold-hardiness models,\nwhich help farmers decide when to deploy expensive frost-mitigation measures.\nUnfortunately, cold-hardiness data for model training is only available for\nsome fruit cultivars due to the need for specialized equipment and expertise.\nRather, farmers often do have years of phenological data (e.g. date of\nbudbreak) that they regularly collect for their crops. In this work, we\nintroduce a new transfer-learning framework, Transfer via Auxiliary Labels\n(TAL), that allows farmers to leverage the phenological data to produce more\naccurate cold-hardiness predictions, even when no cold-hardiness data is\navailable for their specific crop. The framework assumes a set of source tasks\n(cultivars) where each has associated primary labels (cold hardiness) and\nauxiliary labels (phenology).

The goal of TAL is to predict\nprimary labels for the target task via transfer from the source tasks.\nSurprisingly, despite the vast literature on transfer learning, to our\nknowledge, the TAL formulation has not been previously addressed.

However, existing optimization methods exhibit significant\nshortcomings: regression-based losses like L1/L2 lack correlation with IoU,\nIoU-based losses are unstable and limited to simple shapes, and task-specific\nmethods are computationally intensive and not generalizable accross domains. As\na result, the current landscape of parametric shape objective functions has\nbecome scattered, with each domain proposing distinct IoU approximations. To\naddress this, we unify the parametric shape optimization objective functions by\nintroducing Marginalized Generalized IoU (MGIoU), a novel loss function that\novercomes these challenges by projecting structured convex shapes onto their\nunique shape Normals to compute one-dimensional normalized GIoU.

However, irregular rain patterns and complex geometric overlaps\nchallenge single-paradigm architectures, necessitating a unified framework to\nintegrate complementary global-local and spatial-channel representations. To\naddress this, we propose a novel Cross Paradigm Representation and Alignment\nTransformer (CPRAformer). Its core idea is the hierarchical representation and\nalignment, leveraging the strengths of both paradigms (spatial-channel and\nglobal-local) to aid image reconstruction. It bridges the gap within and\nbetween paradigms, aligning and coordinating them to enable deep interaction\nand fusion of features. Specifically, we use two types of self-attention in the\nTransformer blocks: sparse prompt channel self-attention (SPC-SA) and spatial\npixel refinement self-attention (SPR-SA). SPC-SA enhances global channel\ndependencies through dynamic sparsity, while SPR-SA focuses on spatial rain\ndistribution and fine-grained texture recovery. To address the feature\nmisalignment and knowledge differences between them, we introduce the Adaptive\nAlignment Frequency Module (AAFM), which aligns and interacts with features in\na two-stage progressive manner, enabling adaptive guidance and complementarity.\nThis reduces the information gap within and between paradigms.

Recent methods, like\nRoboDreamer, utilize linguistic decomposition to divide instructions into\nseparate lower-level primitives, conditioning the world model on these\nprimitives to achieve compositional instruction-following. However, these\nseparate primitives do not consider the relationships that exist between them.\nFurthermore, recent methods neglect valuable visual guidance, including depth\nand semantic guidance, both crucial for enhancing visual quality. This paper\nintroduces ManipDreamer, an advanced world model based on the action tree and\nvisual guidance. To better learn the relationships between instruction\nprimitives, we represent the instruction as the action tree and assign\nembeddings to tree nodes, each instruction can acquire its embeddings by\nnavigating through the action tree.

The algorithm was incorporated into a fully\nautomated treatment planning script and evaluated on 20 simulated patient\ncases, each with 10 brain metastases and 21 Gy prescriptions.

Based on ensemble\nvariability and structure function analysis we demonstrate that the selected\nobjects in our sample are representative of the typical quasar population and\nshow behaviour, consistent with other quasar samples. Our analysis strengthens\nprevious results, for example that variability decreases with the rest-frame\nwavelength and that it exhibits peaks for certain absolute magnitudes of the\nquasars. Similarly, the structure function shows an increase in variability for\nrest-frame time lags below ~1500 d and a decrease for longer lags, just like in\nprevious studies. Our selection, even though it is based on two epochs only,\nseems to be surprisingly robust, showing up to ~11% contamination by quasars\nthat show stable non-variable behaviour in ZTF.","main_category":"astro-ph.GA","categories":"astro-ph.GA","published":"2025-04-23T14:04:47Z"}

We utilize recent advancements in 3D reconstruction based on Gaussian\nSplatting for 3D object placement in driving scenes.

An industrial case study reported\nthat developers spend 1.28% of their time repairing flaky tests at a monthly\ncost of $2,250. We discovered that flaky tests often exist in clusters, with\nco-occurring failures that share the same root causes, which we call systemic\nflakiness. This suggests that developers can reduce repair costs by addressing\nshared root causes, enabling them to fix multiple flaky tests at once rather\nthan tackling them individually. This study represents an inflection point by\nchallenging the deep-seated assumption that flaky test failures are isolated\noccurrences. We used an established dataset of 10,000 test suite runs from 24\nJava projects on GitHub, spanning domains from data orchestration to job\nscheduling. It contains 810 flaky tests, which we levered to perform a\nmixed-method empirical analysis of co-occurring flaky test failures. Systemic\nflakiness is significant and widespread. We performed agglomerative clustering\nof flaky tests based on their failure co-occurrence, finding that 75% of flaky\ntests across all projects belong to a cluster, with a mean cluster size of 13.5\nflaky tests. Instead of requiring 10,000 test suite runs to identify systemic\nflakiness, we demonstrated a lightweight alternative by training machine\nlearning models based on static test case distance measures.

We find that the $g$-mode overlap integral can reach up to $\\sim\n10\\%$ of the $f$-mode value for hybrid star masses in the range\n1.4-2.0$M_{\\odot}$, with the largest values generally associated with larger\ndensity jumps. This leads to a GW phase shift due to the $g$-mode of $\\Delta\n\\phi_g \\lesssim 0.1$-$1$ rad (i.e., up to $\\sim$5\\%-10\\% of $\\Delta \\phi_f$),\nwith the largest shifts occurring for masses near the phase transition.

Concurrently, the HEB supplements high-frequency\ninformation, effectively addressing the loss of critical details, such as edges\nand textures, in multi-task image restoration scenarios. Extensive experiments\non a mixed dataset containing seven degradation types show that DPMambaIR\nachieves the best performance, with 27.69dB and 0.893 in PSNR and SSIM,\nrespectively. These results highlight the potential and superiority of\nDPMambaIR as a unified solution for All-in-One image restoration.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,I.4.4","published":"2025-04-24T16:46:32Z"}

However, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities\nand inability to distinguish between instructions and data content, LLMs are\nvulnerable to prompt injection attacks. These attacks manipulate LLMs into\ndeviating from the original input instructions and executing maliciously\ninjected instructions within data content, such as web documents retrieved from\nsearch engines. Existing defense methods, including prompt-engineering and\nfine-tuning approaches, typically instruct models to follow the original input\ninstructions while suppressing their tendencies to execute injected\ninstructions. However, our experiments reveal that suppressing\ninstruction-following tendencies is challenging. Through analyzing failure\ncases, we observe that although LLMs tend to respond to any recognized\ninstructions, they are aware of which specific instructions they are executing\nand can correctly reference them within the original prompt. Motivated by these\nfindings, we propose a novel defense method that leverages, rather than\nsuppresses, the instruction-following abilities of LLMs. Our approach prompts\nLLMs to generate responses that include both answers and their corresponding\ninstruction references. Based on these references, we filter out answers not\nassociated with the original input instructions.

Despite its importance, no existing method has been\nexplicitly designed for this task. While polygonal building outline extraction\nhas been extensively studied, the unique characteristics of roads, such as\nbranching structures and topological connectivity, pose challenges to these\nmethods.

The study reveals that voltage\nstimulation significantly enhances the healing and growth of biological\ntissues, accelerating the regeneration process across various growth modalities\nand steering towards isotropic growth conditions that do not favor any specific\ngrowth pathways. Enhancing the electroelastic coupling parameters improves the\nefficacy of bioelectric devices, initiating contraction and fortification of\nbiological tissues in alignment with the electric field.

To capture such effects in a\nmodel-independent way, we extend the Effective Metric Description (EMD)\npreviously introduced in [Phys.Rev.D 109 (2024) 2, 024045, Eur.Phys.J.C 84\n(2024) 12, 1273] for spherically symmetric and static black holes. The EMD\nparametrizes deformations of the metric in terms of physical quantities, such\nas the radial spatial distance to the event horizon. While the latter is still\nviable for non-extremal charged black holes, we argue that the proper time of a\nfree-falling observer is better suited in the extremal case: we derive the\nnecessary conditions for the parameters of such an EMD for constructing a\nconsistent space-time in the vicinity of the (extremal) horizon. Finally, we\nillustrate our framework through a concrete example, and mention implications\nof the Weak Gravity Conjecture on the effective metric parameters.","main_category":"gr-qc","categories":"gr-qc,hep-th","published":"2025-04-29T14:23:33Z"}

While existing SLLMs\ndemonstrate strong performance in speech instruction-following for core\nlanguages (e.g., English), they often struggle with non-core languages due to\nthe scarcity of paired speech-text data and limited multilingual semantic\nreasoning capabilities. To address this, we propose the semi-implicit\nCross-lingual Speech Chain-of-Thought (XS-CoT) framework, which integrates\nspeech-to-text translation into the reasoning process of SLLMs. The XS-CoT\ngenerates four types of tokens: instruction and response tokens in both core\nand non-core languages, enabling cross-lingual transfer of reasoning\ncapabilities. To mitigate inference latency in generating target non-core\nresponse tokens, we incorporate a semi-implicit CoT scheme into XS-CoT, which\nprogressively compresses the first three types of intermediate reasoning tokens\nwhile retaining global reasoning logic during training. By leveraging the\nrobust reasoning capabilities of the core language, XS-CoT improves responses\nfor non-core languages by up to 45\\% in GPT-4 score when compared to direct\nsupervised fine-tuning on two representative SLLMs, Qwen2-Audio and SALMONN.\nMoreover, the semi-implicit XS-CoT reduces token delay by more than 50\\% with a\nslight drop in GPT-4 scores.

The elastic\nparameters of the homogenized material models are randomly varied in space to\nintroduce heterogeneity independently of the geometric properties of the\ndiscrete model. Several forms of randomization are investigated using\nstatistical properties of nodal stress oscillations in periodic representative\nvolume elements (RVEs). It is found that the stress oscillations present in\ndiscrete models built on heterogeneous geometric structures with standard\nconstitutive models cannot be replicated by randomization of the elastically\nhomogeneous discrete system.

Traditionally, this process is\nregarded as secure, assuming the teacher model is clean. This belief stems from\nconventional backdoor attacks relying on poisoned training data with backdoor\ntriggers and attacker-chosen labels, which are not involved in the distillation\nprocess. Instead, knowledge distillation uses the outputs of a clean teacher\nmodel to guide the student model, inherently preventing recognition or response\nto backdoor triggers as intended by an attacker. In this paper, we challenge\nthis assumption by introducing a novel attack methodology that strategically\npoisons the distillation dataset with adversarial examples embedded with\nbackdoor triggers.

A\ncomparative evaluation of tracking algorithms, including BoT-SORT, Deep\nOC-SORT, and ByeTrack, highlights the robustness of the Kalman filter in\nproviding smoothed trajectories. Experimental results from diverse scenarios\ndemonstrate improved accuracy in predicting vessel movements, which is\nessential for collision avoidance and situational awareness. The findings\nunderline the necessity of customized datasets and models for inland\nnavigation. Future work will expand the datasets and incorporate vessel\nclassification to refine predictions, supporting both autonomous systems and\nhuman operators in complex environments.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-05-01T15:31:15Z"}

These failures to\ngeneralize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models.\nHowever, language models' in-context learning shows different inductive biases,\nand can generalize better in some of these cases. Here, we explore these\ndifferences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based\nlearning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and\nimprove models' ability to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are\nconstructed to isolate the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining,\nto create clean tests of generalization. We expose pretrained large models to\ncontrolled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context,\nor through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that\nrequire various types of generalization.

Similarly, Neural Delay Differential\nEquations (Neural DDEs) can be interpreted as an infinite depth limit of\nDensely Connected Residual Neural Networks (DenseResNets). In contrast to\ntraditional ResNet architectures, DenseResNets are feed-forward networks that\nallow for shortcut connections across all layers. These additional connections\nintroduce memory in the network architecture, as typical in many modern\narchitectures. In this work, we explore how the memory capacity in neural DDEs\ninfluences the universal approximation property. The key parameter for studying\nthe memory capacity is the product $K \\tau$ of the Lipschitz constant and the\ndelay of the DDE. In the case of non-augmented architectures, where the network\nwidth is not larger than the input and output dimensions, neural ODEs and\nclassical feed-forward neural networks cannot have the universal approximation\nproperty. We show that if the memory capacity $K\\tau$ is sufficiently small,\nthe dynamics of the neural DDE can be approximated by a neural ODE.\nConsequently, non-augmented neural DDEs with a small memory capacity also lack\nthe universal approximation property. In contrast, if the memory capacity\n$K\\tau$ is sufficiently large, we can establish the universal approximation\nproperty of neural DDEs for continuous functions. If the neural DDE\narchitecture is augmented, we can expand the parameter regions in which\nuniversal approximation is possible.

In OFC, the central nervous system (CNS) not only reacts to\nstimuli but proactively predicts and adjusts motor commands, minimizing errors\nand (often energetic) costs through internal models. OFC theory assumes that\nthere exists a cost function that is optimized throughout one's movement. It is\nnatural to assume that mechanical quantities should be involved in cost\nfunctions.

In this paper, we propose a more efficient\nalternative that approaches the problem from the perspective of parallel\ndenoising.

Hence, an efficient navigation plan is essential for the final\nsuccess. This paper proposes a novel parameter-efficient action planner using\nlarge language models (PEAP-LLM) to generate a single-step instruction at each\nlocation. The proposed model consists of two modules, LLM goal planner (LGP)\nand LoRA action planner (LAP). Initially, LGP extracts the goal-oriented plan\nfrom REVERIE instructions, including the target object and room. Then, LAP\ngenerates a single-step instruction with the goal-oriented plan, high-level\ninstruction, and current visual observation as input.

This\ncorrelation is disrupted when playing the electronic version of the instrument,\nwhich is often purchased by musicians seeking to reduce the sound produced\n(e.g. playing in apartments). The aim of this study was therefore to analyze\nwhether drumming on electronic equipment would lead to a change in the\nkinematics and feel of drummers. To this end, several drummers were recruited\nto perform repeated rhythms at different pitches on acoustic and electric drums\nunder two sound conditions (sound on and sound off with noise-canceling\nheadphones). The sound produced and the kinematics of the upper limbs were\nmeasured by video motion capture during the beats. In addition,\nself-confrontation interviews were conducted after each condition. The\ndrummers, confronted with video recordings of their actions, were asked to\ndescribe, explain and comment step by step on their performance. These\ninterviews were also used to assess their ability to maintain a constant strike\nforce. A questionnaire was used to obtain subjective information on how they\nfelt. The results showed a lower sound power of electronic drums, despite a\nsimilar striking speed.

We use a photonic-integrated circuit to\ngenerate dual, microresonator-soliton frequency combs whose interferogram is\nfundamentally composed of harmonic signals spanning the mmW and THz bands. By\nphase coherence of the dual comb, we precisely stabilize and synthesize the\ninterferogram to generate any output frequency from DC to >1000 GHz. Across\nthis entire range, the synthesizer exhibits exceptional absolute fractional\nfrequency accuracy and precision, characterized by an Allan deviation of\n3*10^(-12) in 1 s measurements. We use a modified uni-traveling-carrier (MUTC)\nphotodiode with an operating frequency range to 500 GHz to convert the\ninterferogram to an electrical signal, generating continuously tunable tones\nacross the entire mmW band. The synthesizer phase noise at a reference\nfrequency of 150 GHz is -83 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset, which exceeds the\nintrinsic performance of state-of-the-art CMOS electronics. Our work harnesses\nthe coherence, bandwidth, and integration of photonics to universally extend\nthe frequency range of current, advanced-node CMOS microwave electronics to the\nmmW and THz bands.","main_category":"physics.optics","categories":"physics.optics","published":"2025-05-13T16:13:43Z"}

We prove\nformally that for any well-defined probability distribution, sequence\nperplexity is invariant under any factorization, including forward, backward,\nor arbitrary permutations. This result establishes a rigorous theoretical\nfoundation for studying how LLMs learn from data and defines principled\nprotocols for empirical evaluation. Applying these protocols, we show that\nprior studies examining ordering effects suffer from critical methodological\nflaws. We retrain GPT-2 models across forward, backward, and arbitrary permuted\norders on scientific text. We find systematic deviations from theoretical\ninvariance across all orderings with arbitrary permutations strongly deviating\nfrom both forward and backward models, which largely (but not completely)\nagreed with one another. Deviations were traceable to differences in\nself-attention, reflecting positional and locality biases in processing. Our\ntheoretical and empirical results provide novel avenues for understanding\npositional biases in LLMs and suggest methods for detecting when LLMs'\nprobability distributions are inconsistent and therefore untrustworthy.","main_category":"cs.CL","categories":"cs.CL","published":"2025-05-13T16:52:19Z"}

These difficulties are further magnified in the\nmultilingual setting, where the need for multimodal data in different languages\nexacerbates existing data scarcity, machine translation often distorts meaning,\nand catastrophic forgetting is more pronounced. To address the aforementioned\nchallenges, we introduce novel techniques spanning both data and modeling.\nFirst, we develop a synthetic annotation framework that curates high-quality,\ndiverse multilingual multimodal instruction data, enabling Aya Vision models to\nproduce natural, human-preferred responses to multimodal inputs across many\nlanguages. Complementing this, we propose a cross-modal model merging technique\nthat mitigates catastrophic forgetting, effectively preserving text-only\ncapabilities while simultaneously enhancing multimodal generative performance.\nAya-Vision-8B achieves best-in-class performance compared to strong multimodal\nmodels such as Qwen-2.5-VL-7B, Pixtral-12B, and even much larger\nLlama-3.2-90B-Vision. We further scale this approach with Aya-Vision-32B, which\noutperforms models more than twice its size, such as Molmo-72B and\nLLaMA-3.2-90B-Vision. Our work advances multilingual progress on the\nmulti-modal frontier, and provides insights into techniques that effectively\nbend the need for compute while delivering extremely high performance.","main_category":"cs.CL","categories":"cs.CL,cs.CV,cs.LG","published":"2025-05-13T17:03:48Z"}

In this work, we propose a structured pruning\nmethod, SPAT ($\\textbf{S}$ensitivity $\\textbf{P}$runer for\n$\\textbf{At}$tention), which selectively removes redundant attention mechanisms\nand yields highly effective models. Different from previous approaches, SPAT\naims to remove the entire attention module, which reduces the risk of\noverfitting and enables speed-up without demanding specialized hardware. We\npropose a dynamic sensitivity metric, $\\textbf{S}$ensitivity\n$\\textbf{E}$nhanced $\\textbf{N}$ormalized $\\textbf{D}$ispersion (SEND) that\nmeasures the importance of each attention module during the pre-training phase.\nExperiments on multivariate datasets demonstrate that SPAT-pruned models\nachieve reductions of 2.842% in MSE, 1.996% in MAE, and 35.274% in FLOPs.\nFurthermore, SPAT-pruned models outperform existing lightweight, Mamba-based\nand LLM-based SOTA methods in both standard and zero-shot inference,\nhighlighting the importance of retaining only the most effective attention\nmechanisms.

However, applying this\nability to robots presents significant challenges due to the inherent\ndifferences between human and robot embodiments in both their visual appearance\nand physical capabilities. While previous methods bridge this gap using\ncross-embodiment datasets with shared scenes and tasks, collecting such aligned\ndata between humans and robots at scale is not trivial. In this paper, we\npropose UniSkill, a novel framework that learns embodiment-agnostic skill\nrepresentations from large-scale cross-embodiment video data without any\nlabels, enabling skills extracted from human video prompts to effectively\ntransfer to robot policies trained only on robot data. Our experiments in both\nsimulation and real-world environments show that our cross-embodiment skills\nsuccessfully guide robots in selecting appropriate actions, even with unseen\nvideo prompts.

It was shown in Youles et\nal. (2022) that random quasar redshift errors produce a smoothing effect on the\nmean quasar continuum in the Ly$\\alpha$ forest region. This in turn gives rise\nto spurious features in the Ly$\\alpha$ auto-correlation, and its\ncross-correlation with quasars. Using synthetic data sets based on the DESI\nsurvey, we confirm that the impact on BAO measurements is small, but that a\nbias is introduced to parameters which depend on the full-shape of our\ncorrelations. We combine a model of this contamination in the cross-correlation\n(Youles et al. 2022) with a new model we introduce here for the\nauto-correlation. These are parametrised by 3 parameters, which when included\nin a joint fit to both correlation functions, successfully eliminate any impact\nof redshift errors on our full-shape constraints. We also present a strategy\nfor removing this contamination from real data, by removing $\\sim$0.3% of\ncorrelating pairs.","main_category":"astro-ph.CO","categories":"astro-ph.CO","published":"2025-05-13T17:59:51Z"}
