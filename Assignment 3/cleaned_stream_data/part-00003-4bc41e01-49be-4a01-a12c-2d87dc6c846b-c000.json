The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on well-known\nbenchmarks in terms of improved BNN predictions and faster BO convergence as\nthe number of decision variables increases.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,stat.ML","published":"2025-04-14T10:21:08Z"}

Our work introduces the first protocol capable of\nretrieving generators of generic open quantum evolution from experimental data,\nthus enabling more precise characterization of many-body non-Markovian effects\nin near-term quantum computing platforms.","main_category":"quant-ph","categories":"quant-ph,cond-mat.other","published":"2025-04-14T16:42:17Z"}

Despite\nthis, conventional DCS suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per single\nacquisition due to the dynamic range limitation of photodetectors imposed by\nthe high peak power of mode-locked pulses, necessitating coherent averaging.\nConsequently, averaging numerous interferograms compromises both the\nexceptional time resolution and places greater demands on long-term mutual\ncoherence and stability. In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach to\nenhance SNR by exploiting the spectral mode enhancement mechanism in\ncoherent-harmonic pulses. As a proof-of-concept, we employ two frequency combs\nwith mode spacing of $\\sim$12.5 MHz, operating at a 20th harmonic repetition\nrate of $\\sim$250 MHz. The result demonstrates a $>$300-fold reduction in\naveraging time while achieving comparable SNR in conventional DCS.

The\nuse of AI systems in high-risk domains have often led users to either\nunder-trust it, potentially causing inadequate reliance or over-trust it,\nresulting in over-compliance. Therefore, users must maintain an appropriate\nlevel of trust. Past research has indicated that explanations provided by AI\nsystems can enhance user understanding of when to trust or not trust the\nsystem. However, the utility of presentation of different explanations forms\nstill remains to be explored especially in high-risk domains. Therefore, this\nstudy explores the impact of different explanation types (text, visual, and\nhybrid) and user expertise (retired police officers and lay users) on\nestablishing appropriate trust in AI-based predictive policing. While we\nobserved that the hybrid form of explanations increased the subjective trust in\nAI for expert users, it did not led to better decision-making. Furthermore, no\nform of explanations helped build appropriate trust. The findings of our study\nemphasize the importance of re-evaluating the use of explanations to build\n[appropriate] trust in AI based systems especially when the system's use is\nquestionable.

Recently, deep learning methods have\nbeen widely used to solve high-dimensional problems, one of which is the\nphysics-informed neural network (PINN). Typically, a deep learning method has\nthree main components: a neural network, a loss function, and an optimizer.\nWhile the construction of the loss function is rooted in the definition of\nsolution space, how to choose a optimal neural network is somewhat ad hoc,\nleaving much room for improvement. In the framework of PINN, we propose an\nunsupervised network architecture search method for solving PDEs, termed\nPINN-DARTS, which applies the differentiable architecture search (DARTS) to\nfind the optimal network architecture structure in a given set of neural\nnetworks. In this set, the number of layers and the number of neurons in each\nlayer can change. In the searching phase, both network and architecture\nparameters are updated simultaneously, so the running time is close to that of\nPINN with a pre-determined network structure. Unlike available works, our\napproach is unsupervised and purely based on the PDE residual without any prior\nusage of solutions. PINN-DARTS outputs the optimal network structure as well as\nthe associated numerical solution. The performance of PINN-DARTS is verified on\nseveral benchmark PDEs, including elliptic, parabolic, wave, and Burgers'\nequations. Compared to traditional architecture search methods, PINN-DARTS\nachieves significantly higher architectural accuracy. Another interesting\nobservation is that both the solution complexity and the PDE type have a\nprominent impact on the optimal network architecture.

However, to realize the swimming\nperformance of biology, there is a need for soft robotic swimmers with both\ndistributed muscles and kinematic feedback. This study presents the design and\nswimming performance of a soft robotic fish with independently controllable\nmuscles and embedded kinematic sensing distributed along the body. The soft\nswimming robot consists of an interior flexible spine, three axially\ndistributed sets of HASEL artificial muscles, embedded strain gauges, a\nstreamlined silicone body, and off-board electronics. In a fixed configuration,\nthe soft robot generates a maximum thrust of 7.9 mN when excited near its first\nresonant frequency (2 Hz) with synchronized antagonistic actuation of all\nmuscles. When excited near its second resonant frequency (8 Hz), synchronized\nmuscle actuation generates 5.0 mN of thrust. By introducing a sequential phase\noffset into the muscle actuation, the thrust at the second resonant frequency\nincreases to 7.2 mN, a 44% increase from simple antagonistic activation. The\nsequential muscle activation improves the thrust by increasing 1) the tail-beat\nvelocity and 2) traveling wave content in the swimming kinematics by four\ntimes. Further, the second resonant frequency (8 Hz) generates nearly as much\nthrust as the first resonance (2 Hz) while requiring only $\\approx25$% of the\ntail displacement, indicating that higher resonant frequencies have benefits\nfor swimming in confined environments where a smaller kinematic envelope is\nnecessary. These results demonstrate the performance benefits of independently\ncontrollable muscles and distributed kinematic sensing, and this type of soft\nrobotic swimmer provides a platform to address the open challenge of\nsensorimotor control.","main_category":"cs.RO","categories":"cs.RO","published":"2025-04-15T16:48:08Z"}

Current\nmethods utilizing airborne or satellite optical imagery to derive bathymetry\nprimarily rely on either SfM-MVS with refraction correction or Spectrally\nDerived Bathymetry (SDB).

In a\nmulti-agent generative chain, content undergoes successive transformations,\noften leaving little, if any, trace of prior contributions. In this study, we\ninvestigates the problem of tracking multi-agent provenance across the temporal\ndimension of generation. We propose a chronological system for post hoc\nattribution of generative history from content alone, without reliance on\ninternal memory states or external meta-information. At its core lies the\nnotion of symbolic chronicles, representing signed and time-stamped records, in\na form analogous to the chain of custody in forensic science. The system\noperates through a feedback loop, whereby each generative timestep updates the\nchronicle of prior interactions and synchronises it with the synthetic content\nin the very act of generation.

Towards\n  long-context evaluation beyond retrieval and haystacks","summary":"Existing multilingual long-context benchmarks, often based on the popular\nneedle-in-a-haystack test, primarily evaluate a model's ability to locate\nspecific information buried within irrelevant texts. However, such a\nretrieval-centric approach is myopic and inherently limited, as successful\nrecall alone does not indicate a model's capacity to reason over extended\ncontexts. Moreover, these benchmarks are susceptible to data leakage,\nshort-circuiting, and risk making the evaluation a priori identifiable. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce MLRBench, a new synthetic benchmark for\nmultilingual long-context reasoning. Unlike existing benchmarks, MLRBench goes\nbeyond surface-level retrieval by including tasks that assess multi-hop\ninference, aggregation, and epistemic reasoning. Spanning seven languages,\nMLRBench is designed to be parallel, resistant to leakage, and scalable to\narbitrary context lengths. Our extensive experiments with an open-weight large\nlanguage model (LLM) reveal a pronounced gap between high- and low-resource\nlanguages, particularly for tasks requiring the model to aggregate multiple\nfacts or predict the absence of information. We also find that, in multilingual\nsettings, LLMs effectively utilize less than 30% of their claimed context\nlength. Although off-the-shelf Retrieval Augmented Generation helps alleviate\nthis to a certain extent, it does not solve the long-context problem. We\nopen-source MLRBench to enable future research in improved evaluation and\ntraining of multilingual LLMs.","main_category":"cs.CL","categories":"cs.CL","published":"2025-04-17T11:02:35Z"}

In this work, we\nmodel and solve the electric bus scheduling problem, lexicographically\nminimizing the size of the bus fleet, the number of charging stops, and the\ntotal energy consumed, to provide decision support for bus operators planning\nto replace their diesel-powered fleet with zero emission vehicles.

Traditional methods often treat exploration and exploitation as\nseparate objectives, lacking a unified inferential foundation. Active\ninference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, offers such a foundation by\nminimizing Expected Free Energy (EFE), a cost function that combines utility\nwith epistemic drives like ambiguity resolution and novelty seeking. However,\nthe computational burden of EFE minimization has remained a major obstacle to\nits scalability. In this paper, we show that EFE-based planning arises\nnaturally from minimizing a variational free energy functional on a generative\nmodel augmented with preference and epistemic priors. This result reinforces\ntheoretical consistency with the Free Energy Principle, by casting planning\nitself as variational inference. Our formulation yields optimal policies that\njointly support goal achievement and information gain, while incorporating a\ncomplexity term that accounts for bounded computational resources.

Nevertheless,\nexploiting non-adjacent nodes to provide valuable messages is challenging, as\nit could generate noisy information and disrupt the original graph structures.\nTo solve it, we propose a novel Degree Fairness Graph Transformer, named\nDegFairGT, to mitigate degree bias by discovering structural similarities\nbetween non-adjacent nodes through learnable structural augmentation and\nstructural self-attention. Our key idea is to exploit non-adjacent nodes with\nsimilar roles in the same community to generate informative edges under our\naugmentation, which could provide informative messages between nodes with\nsimilar roles while ensuring that the homophily principle is maintained within\nthe community. To enable DegFairGT to learn such structural similarities, we\nthen propose a structural self-attention to capture the similarities between\nnode pairs. To preserve global graph structures and prevent graph augmentation\nfrom hindering graph structure, we propose a Self-Supervised Learning task to\npreserve p-step transition probability and regularize graph augmentation.\nExtensive experiments on six datasets showed that DegFairGT outperformed\nstate-of-the-art baselines in degree fairness analysis, node classification,\nand node clustering tasks.","main_category":"cs.AI","categories":"cs.AI,cs.LG","published":"2025-04-21T13:03:40Z"}

Despite recent improvements, small LLMs struggle to handle questions\ninvolving multiple tables and complex SQL patterns under a Zero-Shot Learning\n(ZSL) setting. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) partially compensate the knowledge\ndeficits in pretrained models but falls short while dealing with queries\ninvolving multi-hop reasoning. To bridge this gap, different LLM training\nstrategies to reinforce reasoning capabilities have been proposed, ranging from\nleveraging a thinking process within ZSL, including reasoning traces in SFT, or\nadopt Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies. However, the influence of\nreasoning on Text2SQL performance is still largely unexplored. This paper\ninvestigates to what extent LLM reasoning capabilities influence their Text2SQL\nperformance on four benchmark datasets. To this end, it considers the following\nLLM settings: (1) ZSL, including general-purpose reasoning or not; (2) SFT,\nwith and without task-specific reasoning traces; (3) RL, leveraging execution\naccuracy as primary reward function; (4) SFT+RL, i.e, a two-stage approach that\ncombines SFT and RL. The results show that general-purpose reasoning under ZSL\nproves to be ineffective in tackling complex Text2SQL cases. Small LLMs benefit\nfrom SFT with reasoning much more than larger ones, bridging the gap of their\n(weaker) model pretraining. RL is generally beneficial across all tested models\nand datasets, particularly when SQL queries involve multi-hop reasoning and\nmultiple tables. Small LLMs with SFT+RL excel on most complex datasets thanks\nto a strategic balance between generality of the reasoning process and\noptimization of the execution accuracy.

Existing defense mechanisms\nmainly rely on post-training detection after receiving updates. These methods\neither fail to identify updates which are deliberately fabricated statistically\nclose to benign ones, or show inconsistent performance in different FL training\nstages.

This paper\nproposes a context-aware cognitive augmentation framework that adapts\ninterventions based on three key contextual factors: type, timing, and scale.\nBy leveraging multimodal behavioral cues (e.g., gaze behavior, typing\nhesitation, interaction speed), AI can dynamically adjust cognitive support to\nmaintain or restore flow. We introduce the concept of cognitive flow, an\nextension of flow theory in AI-augmented reasoning, where interventions are\npersonalized, adaptive, and minimally intrusive. By shifting from static\ninterventions to context-aware augmentation, our approach ensures that AI\nsystems support deep engagement in complex decision-making and reasoning\nwithout disrupting cognitive immersion.","main_category":"cs.HC","categories":"cs.HC,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-22T16:35:39Z"}

They find application to fortify various modern\nstorage, communication, and computing systems. Protograph-based (PB) LDPC codes\noffer many degrees of freedom in the code design and enable fast encoding and\ndecoding. In particular, spatially-coupled (SC) and multi-dimensional (MD)\ncirculant-based codes are PB-LDPC codes with excellent performance. Efficient\nfinite-length (FL) algorithms are required in order to effectively exploit the\navailable degrees of freedom offered by SC partitioning, lifting, and MD\nrelocations. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC\nor MC$^2$) method to perform this FL optimization, addressing the removal of\nshort cycles. While iterating, we draw samples from a defined distribution\nwhere the probability decreases as the number of short cycles from the previous\niteration increases. We analyze our MC$^2$ method theoretically as we prove the\ninvariance of the Markov chain where each state represents a possible\npartitioning or lifting arrangement. Via our simulations, we then fit the\ndistribution of the number of cycles resulting from a given arrangement on a\nGaussian distribution. We derive estimates for cycle counts that are close to\nthe actual counts. Furthermore, we derive the order of the expected number of\niterations required by our approach to reach a local minimum as well as the\nsize of the Markov chain recurrent class. Our approach is compatible with code\ndesign techniques based on gradient-descent. Numerical results show that our\nMC$^2$ method generates SC codes with remarkably less number of short cycles\ncompared with the current state-of-the-art. Moreover, to reach the same number\nof cycles, our method requires orders of magnitude less overall time compared\nwith the available literature methods.","main_category":"cs.IT","categories":"cs.IT,eess.SP,math.IT","published":"2025-04-22T17:51:40Z"}

I\nwill also explain the characterisation of the Standard Model gauge group G_SM\nas a subgroup of Spin(10) that was developed in [1]. Thus, the symmetry\nbreaking required to obtain G_SM can be seen to rely on two suitably aligned\ncommuting complex structures on R10. The required complex structures can in\nturn be encoded in a pair of pure spinors of Spin(10). The condition that the\ncomplex structures are commuting and suitably aligned translates into the\nrequirement that the respective pure spinors are orthogonal and that their sum\nis again a pure spinor.

Traditionally, symbolic regression has been implemented\nprimarily through genetic programming that evolves populations of candidate\nsolutions sampled by genetic operators, crossover and mutation. More recently,\nneural networks have been employed to learn the entire analytical model, i.e.,\nits structure and coefficients, using regularized gradient-based optimization.\nAlthough this approach tunes the model's coefficients better, it is prone to\npremature convergence to suboptimal model structures. Here, we propose a\nneuro-evolutionary symbolic regression method that combines the strengths of\nevolutionary-based search for optimal neural network (NN) topologies with\ngradient-based tuning of the network's parameters.

In this paper, we introduce MAYA, a unified, customizable,\nplug-and-play password benchmarking framework. MAYA provides a standardized\napproach for evaluating generative password-guessing models through a rigorous\nset of advanced testing scenarios and a collection of eight real-life password\ndatasets.

The emerging population of inert black hole binaries (BHBs) provides\na unique opportunity to constrain black hole (BH) formation physics.

Inert BHBs allow for narrow\nconstraints to be inferred on the natal kick and mass loss during BH-forming\ncore-collapse events. Aims. In anticipation of the upcoming BLOeM survey, we\naim to provide tight constraints on BH natal kicks by exploiting the full\nparameter space obtained from combined spectroscopic and astrometric data to\ncharacterize the orbits of inert BHBs. Multi-epoch spectroscopy from the BLOeM\nproject will provide measurements of periods, eccentricities, and radial\nvelocities for inert BHBs in the SMC, which complements Gaia astrometric\nobservations of proper motions. Methods. We present a Bayesian parameter\nestimation framework to infer natal kicks and mass loss during core-collapse\nfrom inert BHBs, accounting for all available observables, including the\nsystemic velocity and its orientation relative to the orbital plane. The\nframework further allows for circumstances when some of the observables are\nunavailable, such as for the distant BLOeM sources which preclude resolved\norbits. Results.

Creating a large training dataset encompassing\nall relevant load scenarios is essential for a good surrogate, yet the\ncomputational cost of producing this data quickly becomes a limiting factor.\nCommonly, a pre-trained surrogate is used throughout the computational domain.\nHere, we introduce an alternative adaptive mixture approach that uses a fast\nprobabilistic surrogate model as constitutive model when possible, but resorts\nback to the true high-fidelity model when necessary. The surrogate is thus not\nrequired to be accurate for every possible load condition, enabling a\nsignificant reduction in the data collection time.

This approach enhances the precision of chunk selection across both\nin-domain and out-of-domain context lengths. To make HSA efficient, we further\nintroduce a hardware-aligned kernel design.

While such\napproaches are highly accurate, they are also rather inflexible when it comes\nto adjusting the underlying 3D model after changes in the scene. Structureless\nlocalization approaches represent the scene as a database of images with known\nposes and thus offer a much more flexible representation that can be easily\nupdated by adding or removing images.

In such systems,\ndynamically capturing node information changes is critical for dynamic node\nclassification, which usually requires all labels at every timestamp. However,\nit is difficult to collect all dynamic labels in real-world scenarios due to\nhigh annotation costs and label uncertainty (e.g., ambiguous or delayed labels\nin fraud detection). In contrast, final timestamp labels are easier to obtain\nas they rely on complete temporal patterns and are usually maintained as a\nunique label for each user in many open platforms, without tracking the history\ndata. To bridge this gap, we propose PTCL(Pseudo-label Temporal Curriculum\nLearning), a pioneering method addressing label-limited dynamic node\nclassification where only final labels are available. PTCL introduces: (1) a\ntemporal decoupling architecture separating the backbone (learning time-aware\nrepresentations) and decoder (strictly aligned with final labels), which\ngenerate pseudo-labels, and (2) a Temporal Curriculum Learning strategy that\nprioritizes pseudo-labels closer to the final timestamp by assigning them\nhigher weights using an exponentially decaying function.

When light is employed as the\nnonequilibrium drive, the LLG equation must be supplemented with additional\nterms that are usually conjectured using phenomenological arguments for direct\nopto-magnetic coupling between localized spins and (real or effective) magnetic\nfield of light. However, direct coupling of magnetic field to spins is 1/c\nsmaller than coupling of light and electrons; or both magnetic and electric\nfields are too fast for slow classical spins to be able to follow them. Here,\nwe displace the need for phenomenological arguments by rigorously deriving an\nextended LLG equation via Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT). Within such a\ntheory, light interacts with itinerant electrons, and then spin current carried\nby them exerts spin-transfer torque onto localized spins, so that when\nphotoexcited electrons are integrated out we arrive at a spin-only equation.\nUnlike the standard phenomenological LLG equation with local-in-time Gilbert\ndamping, our extended one contains a non-Markovian memory kernel whose plot\nwithin the plane of its two times variables exhibits fractal properties.

Although existing\ndatasets for OOD in UAV provide valuable resources, they are often designed for\nspecific downstream tasks.Consequently, they exhibit limited generalization\nperformance in real flight scenarios and fail to thoroughly demonstrate\nalgorithm effectiveness in practical environments. To bridge this critical gap,\nwe introduce CODrone, a comprehensive oriented object detection dataset for\nUAVs that accurately reflects real-world conditions. It also serves as a new\nbenchmark designed to align with downstream task requirements, ensuring greater\napplicability and robustness in UAV-based OOD.Based on application\nrequirements, we identify four key limitations in current UAV OOD datasets-low\nimage resolution, limited object categories, single-view imaging, and\nrestricted flight altitudes-and propose corresponding improvements to enhance\ntheir applicability and robustness.Furthermore, CODrone contains a broad\nspectrum of annotated images collected from multiple cities under various\nlighting conditions, enhancing the realism of the benchmark. To rigorously\nevaluate CODrone as a new benchmark and gain deeper insights into the novel\nchallenges it presents, we conduct a series of experiments based on 22\nclassical or SOTA methods.Our evaluation not only assesses the effectiveness of\nCODrone in real-world scenarios but also highlights key bottlenecks and\nopportunities to advance OOD in UAV applications.Overall, CODrone fills the\ndata gap in OOD from UAV perspective and provides a benchmark with enhanced\ngeneralization capability, better aligning with practical applications and\nfuture algorithm development.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-28T17:56:02Z"}

The positive coding gain stems from\nthe sophisticated design of the JSCC encoder, which leverages the residual\ninformation neglected by the SSCC to enhance the learnable image features.\nFurthermore, a conditional rate adaptation mechanism is introduced to adjust\nthe transmission rate of semantic stream according to residual, rendering the\nframework more flexible and efficient to bandwidth allocation. We also design a\ndynamic stream aggregation strategy at the receiver, which provides the\ncomposite framework with more robustness to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nfluctuations in wireless systems compared to a single conventional codec.\nFinally, the proposed framework is verified to surpass the performance of both\ntraditional and DL-based competitors in a large range of scenarios and\nmeanwhile, maintains lightweight in terms of the transmission and computational\ncomplexity of semantic stream, which exhibits the potential to be applied in\nreal systems.","main_category":"cs.IT","categories":"cs.IT,math.IT","published":"2025-04-30T09:41:16Z"}

Our empirical analysis reveals that the benefit\nof using Long-CoT varies across problems: while some problems require elaborate\nreasoning, others show no improvement, or even degraded accuracy. This\nmotivates adaptive reasoning strategies that tailor reasoning depth to the\ninput. However, prior work primarily reduces redundancy within long reasoning\npaths, limiting exploration of more efficient strategies beyond the Long-CoT\nparadigm. To address this, we propose a novel two-stage framework for adaptive\nand efficient reasoning. First, we construct a hybrid reasoning model by\nmerging long and short CoT models to enable diverse reasoning styles. Second,\nwe apply bi-level preference training to guide the model to select suitable\nreasoning styles (group-level), and prefer concise and correct reasoning within\neach style group (instance-level). Experiments demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly reduces inference costs compared to other baseline approaches,\nwhile maintaining performance.

For the first time, MePH precisely\nmodels the correlation between non-invasive multi-view, multi-modal\nechocardiography and the pressure and resistance obtained via RHC. We show that\nMePH significantly outperforms echocardiographers' assessments using\nechocardiography, reducing the mean absolute error in estimating mean pulmonary\narterial pressure (mPAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) by 49.73% and\n43.81%, respectively. In eight independent external hospitals, MePH achieved a\nmean absolute error of 3.147 for PVR assessment. Furthermore, MePH achieved an\narea under the curve of 0.921, surpassing echocardiographers (area under the\ncurve of 0.842) in accurately predicting the severity of pulmonary\nhypertension, whether mild or severe. A prospective study demonstrated that\nMePH can predict treatment efficacy for patients. Our work provides pulmonary\nhypertension patients with a non-invasive and timely method for monitoring\ndisease progression, improving the accuracy and efficiency of pulmonary\nhypertension management while enabling earlier interventions and more\npersonalized treatment decisions.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-05-12T08:38:39Z"}

Effective recourse methods must balance three\nconflicting goals: proximity to the original profile to minimize cost,\nplausibility for realistic recourse, and validity to ensure the desired\noutcome. We show that existing methods train for these objectives separately\nand then search for recourse through a joint optimization over the recourse\ngoals during inference, leading to poor recourse recommendations. We introduce\nGenRe, a generative recourse model designed to train the three recourse\nobjectives jointly. Training such generative models is non-trivial due to lack\nof direct recourse supervision. We propose efficient ways to synthesize such\nsupervision and further show that GenRe's training leads to a consistent\nestimator. Unlike most prior methods, that employ non-robust gradient descent\nbased search during inference, GenRe simply performs a forward sampling over\nthe generative model to produce minimum cost recourse, leading to superior\nperformance across multiple metrics.

Although some studies have\nexplored this area and made notable progress, healthcare recommendation systems\nremain in their nascent stage. And these researches mainly target the treatment\nprocess such as drug or disease recommendations. In addition to the treatment\nprocess, the diagnostic process, particularly determining which medical\nexaminations are necessary to evaluate the condition, also urgently requires\nintelligent decision support. To bridge this gap, we first formalize the task\nof medical examination recommendations. Compared to traditional\nrecommendations, the medical examination recommendation involves more complex\ninteractions. This complexity arises from two folds: 1) The historical medical\nrecords for examination recommendations are heterogeneous and redundant, which\nmakes the recommendation results susceptible to noise. 2) The correlation\nbetween the medical history of patients is often irregular, making it\nchallenging to model spatiotemporal dependencies.

Each\nday, an agent arrives with a private valuation per day of rental, drawn from\nthat day's (known) distribution. The designer can either rent out the asset to\nthe current agent for any number of remaining days, charging them a (possibly\ndifferent) payment per day, or turn the agent away. Agents who arrive when the\nasset is not available are turned away. A defining feature of our dynamic model\nis that agents are \\emph{stagewise-IR} (individually rational), meaning they\nreject any rental agreement that results in temporary negative utility, even if\ntheir final utility is positive.

Specifically, we develop the post-Newtonian method and the\nquasi-circular approximation to derive the periapsis shift respectively for two\ncommon types of magnetic fields, the dipolar one and the asymptotically uniform\none. It is found using the PN method for magnetic fields decaying as fast or\nfaster than a magnetic dipole that the magnetic effect in the periapsis shift\nappears from the same order of the traditional frame-dragging term due to the\nspacetime spin. The magnetic field is found to enhance (or decrease) the\nperiapsis shift when the Lorentz force is attractive (or repulsive). When the\nrepulsive Lorentz force is strong enough, the periapsis shift can become\nnegative. For magnetic fields with a slower decay rate, the periapsis shift of\nquasi-circular orbits exhibits a more complex dependence on the Lorentz force.\nThe periapsis shift increases as the attractive Lorentz force increases from\nzero but will decrease eventually. However, when the Lorentz force is\nrepulsive, the orbit develops local helical loops and the periapsis shift\napproaches $-2\\pi$.

In this work, we focus on the challenge of\nintegrating LAMs into channel state information (CSI) feedback for\nfrequency-division duplex (FDD) massive multiple-intput multiple-output (MIMO)\nsystems. To this end, we propose two offline frameworks, namely site-specific\nLAM-enhanced CSI feedback (SSLCF) and multi-scenario LAM-enhanced CSI feedback\n(MSLCF), that incorporate LAMs into the codebook-based CSI feedback paradigm\nwithout requiring real-time inference. Specifically, SSLCF generates a\nsite-specific enhanced codebook through fine-tuning on locally collected CSI\ndata, while MSLCF improves generalization by pre-generating a set of\nenvironment-aware codebooks.
