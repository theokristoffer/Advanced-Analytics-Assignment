In this study, we experimentally\nand numerically investigate a system of six colloidal particles undergoing two\ntypes of stochastic resetting protocols: global resetting, where all particles\nare returned to their origin simultaneously, and local resetting, where\nparticles are reset one at a time. Our particles interact mainly through\nhard-core repulsion and hydrodynamic flows. We find that the most substantial\neffect of interparticle interactions is observed for local resetting,\nspecifically when particles are physically dragged to the origin. In this case,\nhard-core repulsion broadens the steady-state distribution, while hydrodynamic\ninteractions significantly narrow the distribution. The combination results in\na steady-state distribution that is wider compared to that of a single particle\nsystem both for global and local resetting protocols.","main_category":"cond-mat.soft","categories":"cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.stat-mech","published":"2025-04-14T09:18:37Z"}

To achieve those promising\ngains, accurate channel state information (CSI) needs to be acquired in BD-RIS\nassisted communication systems. However, the number of coefficients in the\ncascaded channels to be estimated in BD-RIS assisted systems is significantly\nlarger than that in conventional RIS assisted systems, because the channels\nassociated with the off-diagonal elements of the scattering matrix have to be\nestimated as well. Surprisingly, for the first time in the literature, this\npaper rigorously shows that the uplink channel estimation overhead in BD-RIS\nassisted systems is actually of the same order as that in the conventional RIS\nassisted systems. This amazing result stems from a key observation: for each\nuser antenna, its cascaded channel matrix associated with one reference BD-RIS\nelement is a scaled version of that associated with any other BD-RIS element\ndue to the common RIS-base station (BS) channel. In other words, the number of\nindependent unknown variables is far less than it would seem at first glance.\nBuilding upon this property, this paper manages to characterize the minimum\noverhead to perfectly estimate all the channels in the ideal case without noise\nat the BS, and propose a twophase estimation framework for the practical case\nwith noise at the BS. Numerical results demonstrate outstanding channel\nestimation overhead reduction over existing schemes in BD-RIS assisted systems.","main_category":"eess.SP","categories":"eess.SP,cs.IT,math.IT","published":"2025-04-15T06:48:08Z"}

To address these challenges, we\npropose GFSE, a universal graph structural encoder designed to capture\ntransferable structural patterns across diverse domains such as molecular\ngraphs, social networks, and citation networks.

Recently, Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful tool to optimize resource allocation\npolicies in business processes. In the DRL framework, an agent learns a policy\nthrough interaction with the environment, guided solely by reward signals that\nindicate the quality of its decisions. However, existing algorithms are not\nsuitable for dynamic environments such as business processes. Furthermore,\nexisting DRL-based methods rely on engineered reward functions that approximate\nthe desired objective, but a misalignment between reward and objective can lead\nto undesired decisions or suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we\npropose a rollout-based DRL algorithm and a reward function to optimize the\nobjective directly. Our algorithm iteratively improves the policy by evaluating\nexecution trajectories following different actions. Our reward function\ndirectly decomposes the objective function of minimizing the mean cycle time.\nMaximizing our reward function guarantees that the objective function is\nminimized without requiring extensive reward engineering.

In this study we analyze the\nphysical processes of an overshoot of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning\nCirculation (AMOC), one of the major tipping elements, using a conceptual box\nmodel. Here either the atmospheric temperature above the North Atlantic, or the\nfreshwater forcing into the North Atlantic overshoot their respective critical\nboundaries. In both cases a higher forcing rate can prevent a collapse of the\nAMOC, since a higher rate of forcing causes initially a fresher North Atlantic,\nwhich in turn results in a higher northward transport by the subtropical gyre\nsupplementing the salinity loss in time. For small exceedance amplitudes the\nAMOC is still resilient as the forcing rates can be low and so other state\nvariables outside of the North Atlantic can adjust. Contrarily, for larger\novershoots the trajectories are dynamically similar and we find a lower limit\nin volume and exceedance time for respectively freshwater and temperature\nforcing in order to prevent a collapse. Moreover, for a large overshoot an\nincreased air-sea temperature coupling has a destabilizing effect, while the\nreverse holds for an overshoot close to the tipping point.

To address this problem, this paper proposes\nFedX, a novel adaptive model decomposition and quantization FL system for IoT.\nTo balance utility with resource constraints on IoT devices, FedX decomposes a\nglobal FL model into different sub-networks with adaptive numbers of quantized\nbits for different devices. The key idea is that a device with fewer resources\nreceives a smaller sub-network for lower overhead but utilizes a larger number\nof quantized bits for higher model utility, and vice versa. The quantization\noperations in FedX are done at the server to reduce the computational load on\ndevices.

This work aims to address this challenge by\nproposing a general template model and establishing an efficient motion\nplanning and control pipeline. To start, we propose a reduced-order template\nmodel-the dual-legged actuated spring-loaded inverted pendulum with trunk\nrotation-which explicitly models parallel compliance by decoupling spring\neffects from active motor actuation. With this template model, versatile\nacrobatic motions, such as pronking, froggy jumping, and hop-turn, are\ngenerated by a dual-layer trajectory optimization, where the singularity-free\nbody rotation representation is taken into consideration.

For example, the maximal pronking\ndistance, hop-turn yaw angle, and froggy jumping distance increase at least by\n25%, 15% and 25%, respectively; iii) parallel elasticity improves the\nrobustness against dynamic uncertainties, including modelling errors and\nexternal disturbances.

Existing methods typically rely on a\nthought-action-observation (TAO) process to enhance LLM performance, but these\napproaches are often constrained by the LLMs' limited knowledge of complex\ntasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers new opportunities by\nleveraging external databases to ground generation in retrieved information. In\nthis paper, we identify two key challenges (enlargability and transferability)\nin applying RAG to task planning. We propose InstructRAG, a novel solution\nwithin a multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning framework, to address these\nchallenges. InstructRAG includes a graph to organize past instruction paths\n(sequences of correct actions), an RL-Agent with Reinforcement Learning to\nexpand graph coverage for enlargability, and an ML-Agent with Meta-Learning to\nimprove task generalization for transferability. The two agents are trained\nend-to-end to optimize overall planning performance. Our experiments on four\nwidely used task planning datasets demonstrate that InstructRAG significantly\nenhances performance and adapts efficiently to new tasks, achieving up to a\n19.2% improvement over the best existing approach.","main_category":"cs.AI","categories":"cs.AI,cs.IR","published":"2025-04-17T15:41:39Z"}

This paper proposes inference-friendly\ngraph compression (IFGC), a graph compression scheme to accelerate GNNs\ninference. Given a graph $G$ and a GNN $M$, an IFGC computes a small compressed\ngraph $G_c$, to best preserve the inference results of $M$ over $G$, such that\nthe result can be directly inferred by accessing $G_c$ with no or little\ndecompression cost. (1) We characterize IFGC with a class of inference\nequivalence relation. The relation captures the node pairs in $G$ that are not\ndistinguishable for GNN inference. (2) We introduce three practical\nspecifications of IFGC for representative GNNs: structural preserving\ncompression (SPGC), which computes $G_c$ that can be directly processed by GNN\ninference without decompression; ($\\alpha$, $r$)-compression, that allows for a\nconfigurable trade-off between compression ratio and inference quality, and\nanchored compression that preserves inference results for specific nodes of\ninterest. For each scheme, we introduce compression and inference algorithms\nwith guarantees of efficiency and quality of the inferred results.

Of these, the semiparametric DID (SDID)\napproach incorporates a propensity score analysis into the DID setup. Supposing\nthat the ATT is a function of covariates, we estimate it by weighting the\ninverse of the propensity score. As one method to make the estimation robust to\nthe propensity score modeling, we incorporate covariate balancing. Then, by\nattentively constructing the moment conditions used in the covariate balancing,\nwe show that the proposed estimator has doubly robustness. In addition to the\nestimation, model selection is also addressed. In practice, covariate selection\nis an essential task in statistical analysis, but even in the basic setting of\nthe SDID approach, there are no reasonable information criteria. Therefore, we\nderive a model selection criterion as an asymptotically bias-corrected\nestimator of risk based on the loss function used in the SDID estimation.

In this work, a low-loss PPLNOI ridge\nwaveguide with a length of 7 mm was fabricated using ultra-smooth sidewalls\nthrough photolithography-assisted chemo-mechanical etching followed by\nhigh-voltage pulse poling. The average surface roughness was measured at just\n0.27 nm, resulting in significantly lower propagation loss compared to\ndry-etched counterparts. Highly efficient second-harmonic generation was\ndemonstrated with a normalized efficiency of 1742%/(W*cm^2) and an overall\nefficiency of 750.1%/W (without accounting for propagation loss).

This study tackles the most difficult subtask when both\ntarget labels and source data are inaccessible, namely, source-free domain\nadaptation. To reuse the classification backbone pre-trained on source data,\ntime series reconstruction is a sound solution that aligns target and source\ntime series by minimizing the reconstruction errors of both. However, simply\nfine-tuning the source pre-trained reconstruction model on target data may lose\nthe learnt priori, and it struggles to accommodate domain varying temporal\npatterns in a single encoder-decoder. Therefore, this paper tries to\ndisentangle the composition of domain transferability by using a compositional\narchitecture for time series reconstruction. Here, the preceding component is a\nU-net frozen since pre-trained, the output of which during adaptation is the\ninitial reconstruction of a given target time series, acting as a coarse step\nto prompt the subsequent finer adaptation. The following pipeline for finer\nadaptation includes two parallel branches: The source replay branch using a\nresidual link to preserve the output of U-net, and the offset compensation\nbranch that applies an additional autoencoder (AE) to further warp U-net's\noutput. By deploying a learnable factor on either branch to scale their\ncomposition in the final output of reconstruction, the data transferability is\ndisentangled and the learnt reconstructive capability from source data is\nretained. During inference, aside from the batch-level optimization in the\ntraining, we search at test time stability-aware rescaling of source replay\nbranch to tolerate instance-wise variation.

In a previous specific heat study [K. Semeniuk et al. Phys.

From\nthermodynamic arguments we expected the phase-I boundary line to cross phase\nSC2 at a tetracritical point.

Existing registration methods rely\nheavily on anatomical landmark-based workflows, which encounter two major\nlimitations: 1) ambiguous landmark definitions fail to provide efficient\nmarkers for registration; 2) insufficient integration of intraoperative liver\nvisual information in shape deformation modeling. To address these challenges,\nin this paper, we propose a landmark-free preoperative-to-intraoperative\nregistration framework utilizing effective self-supervised learning, termed\n\\ourmodel. This framework transforms the conventional 3D-2D workflow into a\n3D-3D registration pipeline, which is then decoupled into rigid and non-rigid\nregistration subtasks. \\ourmodel~first introduces a feature-disentangled\ntransformer to learn robust correspondences for recovering rigid\ntransformations.

We\nfind that multiaccuracy in itself is rather weak, but that the addition of\nglobal calibration (this notion is called calibrated multiaccuracy) boosts its\npower substantially, enough to recover implications that were previously known\nonly assuming the stronger notion of multicalibration.\n  We give evidence that multiaccuracy might not be as powerful as standard weak\nagnostic learning, by showing that there is no way to post-process a\nmultiaccurate predictor to get a weak learner, even assuming the best\nhypothesis has correlation $1/2$. Rather, we show that it yields a restricted\nform of weak agnostic learning, which requires some concept in the class to\nhave correlation greater than $1/2$ with the labels.

In this paper, we identify the main cause of PRM-induced reward\nhacking: the canonical summation-form credit assignment in reinforcement\nlearning (RL), which defines the value as cumulative gamma-decayed future\nrewards, easily induces LLMs to hack steps with high rewards. To address this,\nwe propose PURE: Process sUpervised Reinforcement lEarning. The key innovation\nof PURE is a min-form credit assignment that formulates the value function as\nthe minimum of future rewards. This method significantly alleviates reward\nhacking by limiting the value function range and distributing advantages more\nreasonably. Through extensive experiments on 3 base models, we show that\nPRM-based approaches enabling min-form credit assignment achieve comparable\nreasoning performance to verifiable reward-based methods within only 30% steps.\nIn contrast, the canonical sum-form credit assignment collapses training even\nat the beginning! Additionally, when we supplement PRM-based fine-tuning with\njust 10% verifiable rewards, we further alleviate reward hacking and produce\nthe best fine-tuned model based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B in our experiments,\nachieving 82.5% accuracy on AMC23 and 53.3% average accuracy across 5\nbenchmarks. Moreover, we summarize the observed reward hacking cases and\nanalyze the causes of training collapse.

When underwater visibility is insufficient, only sonar\nsystems can provide stable data, which necessitates exploration of the\nunderwater acoustic object tracking (UAOT) task. Previous studies have explored\ntraditional methods and Siamese networks for UAOT. However, the absence of a\nunified evaluation benchmark has significantly constrained the value of these\nmethods. To alleviate this limitation, we propose the first large-scale UAOT\nbenchmark, SonarT165, comprising 165 square sequences, 165 fan sequences, and\n205K high-quality annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that SonarT165\nreveals limitations in current state-of-the-art SOT trackers. To address these\nlimitations, we propose STFTrack, an efficient framework for acoustic object\ntracking. It includes two novel modules, a multi-view template fusion module\n(MTFM) and an optimal trajectory correction module (OTCM). The MTFM module\nintegrates multi-view feature of both the original image and the binary image\nof the dynamic template, and introduces a cross-attention-like layer to fuse\nthe spatio-temporal target representations. The OTCM module introduces the\nacoustic-response-equivalent pixel property and proposes normalized pixel\nbrightness response scores, thereby suppressing suboptimal matches caused by\ninaccurate Kalman filter prediction boxes.

A key metric for functional safety is achieving a sufficient\nfault coverage. To meet this requirement, extensive time-consuming fault\nsimulation of the RTL code is necessary during the chip design phase.The main\noverhead in RTL fault simulation comes from simulating behavioral nodes (always\nblocks). Due to the limited fault propagation capacity, fault simulation\nresults often match the good simulation results for many behavioral nodes. A\nkey strategy for accelerating RTL fault simulation is the identification and\nelimination of redundant simulations. Existing methods detect redundant\nexecutions by examining whether the fault inputs to each RTL node are\nconsistent with the good inputs. However, we observe that this input comparison\nmechanism overlooks a significant amount of implicit redundant execution:\nalthough the fault inputs differ from the good inputs, the node's execution\nresults remain unchanged.

Existing methods have notable limitations: textual approaches offer\nhigh-level semantic guidance but struggle to describe complex actions\naccurately; trajectory-based techniques provide intuitive global motion\ndirection yet often fall short in generating precise or customized character\nmovements; and anchor poses-guided methods are typically confined to synthesize\nonly simple motion patterns. To generate more controllable and precise human\nmotions, we propose \\textbf{ProMoGen (Progressive Motion Generation)}, a novel\nframework that integrates trajectory guidance with sparse anchor motion\ncontrol. Global trajectories ensure consistency in spatial direction and\ndisplacement, while sparse anchor motions only deliver precise action guidance\nwithout displacement. This decoupling enables independent refinement of both\naspects, resulting in a more controllable, high-fidelity, and sophisticated\nmotion synthesis. ProMoGen supports both dual and single control paradigms\nwithin a unified training process. Moreover, we recognize that direct learning\nfrom sparse motions is inherently unstable, we introduce \\textbf{SAP-CL (Sparse\nAnchor Posture Curriculum Learning)}, a curriculum learning strategy that\nprogressively adjusts the number of anchors used for guidance, thereby enabling\nmore precise and stable convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nProMoGen excels in synthesizing vivid and diverse motions guided by predefined\ntrajectory and arbitrary anchor frames.

We observe that in T2V generation tasks, the generated videos\noften contain substantial redundant information not explicitly specified in the\ntext prompts, such as environmental elements, secondary objects, and additional\ndetails, providing opportunities for malicious attackers to embed hidden\nharmful content. Exploiting this inherent redundancy, we introduce BadVideo,\nthe first backdoor attack framework tailored for T2V generation. Our attack\nfocuses on designing target adversarial outputs through two key strategies: (1)\nSpatio-Temporal Composition, which combines different spatiotemporal features\nto encode malicious information; (2) Dynamic Element Transformation, which\nintroduces transformations in redundant elements over time to convey malicious\ninformation.

A recently introduced technique, called the\nsize-invariant shape transformation, overcomes this by introducing a new\ncontrol parameter that deforms the potential landscape without altering system\nsize, enabling nonuniform level scaling. This shape parameter gives rise to\nquantum shape effects in confined systems, conceptually distinct from quantum\nsize effects. We explore the limits of this phenomenon by asking: what is the\nminimal system in which such spectral behavior can emerge? We show that even a\ntwo-level system can exhibit thermodynamic consequences of quantum shape\neffects, including spontaneous transitions into lower-entropy states, a feature\nabsent in classical thermodynamics for non-interacting systems. We identify the\norigin as geometry-induced asymmetric level coupling, where the ground-state\nenergy and level spacing respond oppositely to shape changes. This extends to\nmany-level systems, where the thermally averaged level spacing and ground-state\nenergy evolve in opposite directions. We construct spontaneity maps revealing\nenergy- and entropy-driven spontaneous processes. These behaviors emerge under\nquasistatic, isothermal deformations and show how geometry alone can induce\nthermodynamic effects typically exclusive to interacting or open systems.

Jet-interstellar medium (ISM)\ninteraction sites near black hole X-ray binaries provide unique laboratories to\nstudy jet energetics. This work aims to detect and characterise the bow shock\nnear one black hole X-ray binary, Cyg X-1, and then use this bow shock\nstructure to parametrise the properties of the jet launched by Cyg X-1 over its\nlifetime. We used the MeerKAT radio telescope to investigate the bow shock\nstructure formed by the interaction between the jets of Cyg X-1 and the ISM.

The contribution of the paper is rooted in a measured-state\ninitialization strategy. First, due to the nonzero probability of violating\nchance-constraints in the case of unbounded noise, we introduce\nellipsoidal-based probabilistic reachable sets and we include constraint\nrelaxations to recover recursive feasibility conditioned to the measured state.\nSecond, we prove that the solution of this novel SMPC scheme guarantees\nclosed-loop chance constraints satisfaction under minimum relaxation. Last, we\ndemonstrate that, in expectation, the need of relaxing the constraints vanishes\nover time, which leads the closed-loop trajectories steered towards the\nunconstrained LQR invariant region. This novel SMPC scheme is proven to satisfy\nthe recursive feasibility conditioned to the state realization, and its\nsuperiority with respect to open-loop initialization schemes is shown through\nnumerical examples.","main_category":"math.OC","categories":"math.OC,cs.SY,eess.SY","published":"2025-04-24T16:26:22Z"}

This study introduces\na novel backdoor detection perspective named Dynamic Attention Analysis (DAA),\nshowing that these dynamic characteristics serve as better indicators for\nbackdoor detection.

However, to propose a black hole model for\nexperimental verification, we must clearly understand which parameters describe\nthe black hole and what physical constraints can be imposed on each parameter.\nWhen considering dynamical black holes with a barotropic equation of state, an\nadditional integration constant arises, the nature of which remains unclear\nexcept for a few specific values of the equation of state coefficient.\nNevertheless, when examining solutions such as Husain or Kiselev, we can\nobserve remarkable effects related to black hole evaporation, which are\nassociated with the violation of null energy conditions. However, the main\nissue lies in the fact that while violations of energy conditions may occur in\nnature, the ambiguity in the values of parameters describing black holes makes\nit difficult to determine whether such violations result from natural physical\nprocesses or are purely mathematical artifacts that should be excluded from\nconsideration. Moreover, energy conditions play a crucial role in the evolution\nof a black hole shadow - a characteristic that can potentially be observed\nexperimentally. In this article, we elucidate the parameter arising in Husain's\nand Kiselev's solutions using nonlinear electrodynamics. We demonstrate that\nfor physically relevant equations of state, the additional parameter represents\na combination of electric and magnetic charges.","main_category":"gr-qc","categories":"gr-qc","published":"2025-04-29T15:53:44Z"}

At the\ntrajectory level, a related quantity can be introduced, the stochastic Fisher\ninformation (SFI), which on average, is equivalent to the FI. In this work, we\ndiscuss two fundamental questions regarding the SFI; namely, (i) what is the\nthermodynamic interpretation of the SFI is and (ii) whether there are any\ntrajectory-level thermodynamic bounds due to the SFI. We find that, contrary to\nprevious results in the literature for the FI, the thermodynamic interpretation\nof the SFI depends only on the entropy produced by the system and on the\nthermodynamic force. Moreover, we find that the SFI allows one to derive\nsingle-trajectory speed limits, which we demonstrate to hold for a Brownian\nparticle under a saturating drive force and a Brownian particle under a\ndecreasing drive force. From the ensemble of single-trajectory bounds one can\nderive a hierarchy of average speed limits that are always less tight than the\none derived from the FI. We test our results for speed limits on the adopted\nmodels and find that the hierarchy of average speed limits is respected and\nthat the single-trajectory speed limits behave qualitatively similarly to the\naverage and stochastic speed limits, with some trajectories achieving\nvelocities higher than the tightest average bound whenever it does not\nsaturate.

To\ncircumvent these challenges, here we demonstrate a novel Laguerre Gaussian\nsingle-pixel imaging (LGSI) technique achieving ultra-low sampling ratio (3%)\nand super-high spatial imaging quality (Structural Similarity (SSIM) of 0.739\nand a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 20.762 dB). The fundamental\nmethodology relies on the enhancement of the encoded patterns by the\ndifferential modulation of discrete orthogonal physical LG moments, enabling\nthe reconstruction of illuminated target object via a linear weighting of the\nstructured light intensity. Leveraging this orthogonal mechanism, LGSI\ndemonstrates superior imaging quality and computational efficiency, surpassing\nthe capabilities of non-orthogonal moments. Comparative analyses of the power\nspectra from reconstructed images highlight the enhanced efficacy of LGSI over\nHadamard SPI (HSI) and Fourier SPI (FSI). Our results suggest the possibility\nof encoding multi-dimensional structured light fields as a promising pathway\nfor realizing low sampling ratio, universal, and physical-endow SPI.","main_category":"physics.optics","categories":"physics.optics","published":"2025-04-30T03:54:13Z"}

This, in turn, can potentially lead to safety concerns if\nautonomous driving systems are not weather-aware, i.e., if they are unable to\ndiscern such changes. In this study, we release a new, large-scale, multi-modal\nemulated rain dataset, REHEARSE-3D, to promote research advancements in 3D\npoint cloud de-raining. Distinct from the most relevant competitors, our\ndataset is unique in several respects. First, it is the largest point-wise\nannotated dataset, and second, it is the only one with high-resolution LiDAR\ndata (LiDAR-256) enriched with 4D Radar point clouds logged in both daytime and\nnighttime conditions in a controlled weather environment. Furthermore,\nREHEARSE-3D involves rain-characteristic information, which is of significant\nvalue not only for sensor noise modeling but also for analyzing the impact of\nweather at a point level. Leveraging REHEARSE-3D, we benchmark raindrop\ndetection and removal in fused LiDAR and 4D Radar point clouds. Our\ncomprehensive study further evaluates the performance of various statistical\nand deep-learning models.

Experimentally, we develop\nstable self-charged perovskite quantum rods (QRs) as an alternative to QDs via\nstate engineering and Mn-doping strategy. An unprecedented\ntwo-order-of-magnitude reduction in nonradiative Auger recombination enables\nQRs to support a sufficient charging number of up to 6. The QR liquid lasing is\nthen achieved with a near-zero threshold of 0.098 using quasi-continuous\npumping of nanosecond pulses, which is the lowest threshold among all reported\nQD lasers. These achievements demonstrate the potential of the specially\nengineered QRs as an excellent gain media and pave the way for their\nprospective applications.","main_category":"cond-mat.mes-hall","categories":"cond-mat.mes-hall,physics.app-ph,physics.optics","published":"2025-05-01T11:31:09Z"}

Pre-training on large datasets have been shown to help models\nlearn transferable representations and adapt with minimal labeled data. This\nbehavior is especially valuable in medical imaging, where annotations are often\nscarce. However, applying this paradigm to multimodal medical data introduces a\nchallenge: most existing approaches assume that all imaging modalities are\navailable during both pre-training and fine-tuning. In practice, missing\nmodalities often occur due to acquisition issues, specialist unavailability, or\nspecific experimental designs on small in-house datasets.

However,\nthese architectural advancements introduce additional latency during the\ninitial attachment procedure of User Equipment (UE), increasing the risk of\nsignaling storms. This paper investigates the latency impact due to\ndisaggregation of the Base-band Unit (BBU) into the Central Unit (CU) and\nDistributed Unit (DU). Specifically, we model the delays induced due to\ndisaggregation on UE attachment, analyzing the performance under varying load\nconditions, and sensitivity to processing times.

Second, the differentiable\noptimization framework confronts significant efficiency issues, especially when\ndealing with multi-constraint problems. To address these challenges, this paper\npresents a CBF-based safe RL architecture that effectively mitigates the issues\noutlined above. The proposed approach constructs a continuous AND logic\napproximation for the multiple constraints using a single composite CBF. By\nleveraging this approximation, a close-form solution of the quadratic\nprogramming is derived for the policy network in RL, thereby circumventing the\nneed for differentiable optimization within the end-to-end safe RL pipeline.\nThis strategy significantly reduces computational complexity because of the\nclosed-form solution while maintaining safety guarantees. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that, in comparison to existing approaches relying on\ndifferentiable optimization, the proposed method significantly reduces training\ncomputational costs while ensuring provable safety throughout the training\nprocess.","main_category":"cs.RO","categories":"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY","published":"2025-05-01T17:22:11Z"}

This is substantially larger\nthan the classical prediction of Higgs Inflation, $n_s \\approx 0.965$, which is\n2.74$\\sigma$ below the ACT mean value. We show that when an otherwise\nmetastable Standard Model Higgs Inflation potential is stabilised by the\naddition of vector-like quark pairs and the potential is renormalised in the\nJordan frame, the value of $n_s$ is generally larger than 0.965 and can explain\nthe ACT observation. As an example, assuming the 2022 PDG direct measurement\ncentral value for the t quark mass, $m_{t} = 172.69$ GeV, and central values\nfor the SM inputs to the renormalisation group equations, we obtain $n_s =\n0.9792 - 0.9844$ for the case of three isosinglet vector-like B quarks with\nmass $m_{Q}$ in the range 1-3 TeV, with the lowest value of the $n_s$ range\nbeing 1.44$\\sigma$ above the ACT mean value.

Films grown on\nmismatched substrates can relieve strain by the creation of slip-plane defects\n- and recently we have shown that these defects can manipulate global physical\nproperties important for application. Here we demonstrate that post growth\nannealing results in near-defect-free, structurally robust films that allow the\nmagnetic order thermal evolution to change as a function of film thickness.\nStrong spin-lattice coupling ensures that substrate clamping limits the ability\nof thinner films to transform as they are cooled to low temperature. However,\nbeyond a certain thickness, films no longer suffer this constraint, revealing\nthe extraordinary transformations that provide the pathway for spin to reach\nthe lowest energy state. We show that this transition cannot be explained by\nthe previously established mechanism of spin rotations in the (111) plane, and\nwe calculate that rotations along the chirality-inverting [1-10] direction may\nbe preferable under certain conditions. Our work suggests that chirality\ninverting rotations in these materials may have been previously overlooked in\nstudies adopting the so-called octupole approximation of the net magnetic\nmoment.

An approach to steer LLM behavior, such as\nmitigating biases or defending against jailbreaks, is to identify which parts\nof a prompt influence specific aspects of the model's output. Token-level\nattribution methods offer a promising solution, but still struggle in text\ngeneration, explaining the presence of each token in the output separately,\nrather than the underlying semantics of the entire LLM response. We introduce\nConceptX, a model-agnostic, concept-level explainability method that identifies\nthe concepts, i.e., semantically rich tokens in the prompt, and assigns them\nimportance based on the outputs' semantic similarity. Unlike current\ntoken-level methods, ConceptX also offers to preserve context integrity through\nin-place token replacements and supports flexible explanation goals, e.g.,\ngender bias.

Additionally, I demonstrated the novel result of the particles\nentering and conforming to the radiation reaction limit regime of Aristotelian\nElectrodynamics. As calibration for the radiation calculations, emission maps,\nand spectra I compared my model output with results from the code of the pulsar\nemission model of Harding and collaborators for a pulsar with $10\\%$ the\n$B$-field strength of Vela and how my results converged to theirs. Next, I\nshowed my exploratory modelling of the magnetic mirror scenario proposed for AR\nSco.

However, these systems often overlook the needs of\npeople with mobility restrictions. Moreover, the use of RGB cameras presents\nsignificant challenges, including limited detection performance under adverse\nweather or low-visibility conditions, as well as heightened privacy concerns.\nTo address these issues, we propose a fully automated, thermal detector-based\ntraffic light system that dynamically adjusts signal durations for individuals\nwith walking impairments or mobility burden and triggers the auditory signal\nfor visually impaired individuals, thereby advancing towards barrier-free\nintersection for all users. To this end, we build the thermal dataset for\npeople with mobility restrictions (TD4PWMR), designed to capture diverse\npedestrian scenarios, particularly focusing on individuals with mobility aids\nor mobility burden under varying environmental conditions, such as different\nlighting, weather, and crowded urban settings. While thermal imaging offers\nadvantages in terms of privacy and robustness to adverse conditions, it also\nintroduces inherent hurdles for object detection due to its lack of color and\nfine texture details and generally lower resolution of thermal images.

The joint optimization of user\nassociation and resource allocation (UARA) is a fundamental issue for future\nwireless networks, as it plays a pivotal role in enhancing overall network\nperformance, user fairness, and resource efficiency. Given the\nlatency-sensitive nature of emerging network applications, network management\nfavors algorithms that are simple and computationally efficient rather than\ncomplex centralized approaches. Thus, distributed pricing-based strategies have\ngained prominence in the UARA literature, demonstrating practicality and\neffectiveness across various objective functions, e.g., sum-rate, proportional\nfairness, max-min fairness, and alpha-fairness. While the alpha-fairness\nframeworks allow for flexible adjustments between efficiency and fairness via a\nsingle parameter $\\alpha$, existing works predominantly assume a homogeneous\nfairness context, assigning an identical $\\alpha$ value to all users.\nReal-world networks, however, frequently require differentiated user\nprioritization due to varying application requirements and latency. To bridge\nthis gap, we propose a novel heterogeneous alpha-fairness (HAF) objective\nfunction, assigning distinct {\\alpha} values to different users, thereby\nproviding enhanced control over the balance between throughput, fairness, and\nlatency across the network.

A pre-existing continuum mean-field model with two parameters is\nrewritten in the language of the latter to model the properties of a network of\nplastic slip events in a perfect copper single crystal under uniaxial tension.\nThe behaviour of the system is simulated in a triangular 2D mesh in 3D space\nemploying a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Phases of distinct character emerge\nand both first-order and second-order phase transitions are observed. The\nphases can be interpreted as representing crystallographic phenomena like\ncross-slip, strain localisation and partial dislocations. The first-order\ntransitions mostly occur as functions of the applied stress, while the\nsecond-order transitions occur exclusively as functions of the mean-field\ncoupling parameter. The former are reminiscent of transitions in other\nstatistical-mechanical models, while the latter find parallels in experimental\nobservations.","main_category":"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","categories":"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.stat-mech,math-ph,math.MP","published":"2025-05-13T15:46:53Z"}

We apply this idea to various minisuperspace models. In\nthe semiclassical regime we recover expected results: the wavefunction peaks on\nthe classical solution and, in models with a scalar field, the variance of\n$\\zeta$ (a mini-superspace analogue of the comoving curvature perturbation) is\nconserved in time. Applied to the no-boundary wavefunction, our model\nhighlights a bouncing behavior, which gives a straightforward quantum\nrepresentation of global de Sitter space. We argue that the inevitable time\ndependence of the variance of the wavefunction breaks some of the classical de\nSitter symmetries. Then, by modeling radiation as a fluid, we analyze the epoch\nof radiation domination near the singularity. The problem is equivalent to an\n$s$-wave scattering off a central power-law potential of the form $-r^{-2/3}$.\nSuch a potential admits bound states, so the system is stable and the\nwavepacket undergoes unitary scattering. The radiation bounce, as opposed to\nthe no-boundary bounce, does not have a classical counterpart as the\ncorresponding classical solutions are singular. During the radiation bounce,\nthe uncertainty and the expectation value of the scale factor become\ncomparable. By selecting a large initial variance, the bounce can be made\narbitrarily smooth, the mean value of the Hubble parameter correspondingly\nsoft.","main_category":"hep-th","categories":"hep-th,astro-ph.CO,gr-qc","published":"2025-05-13T16:08:45Z"}

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08729v1","title":"Assumption-robust Causal Inference","summary":"In observational causal inference, it is common to encounter multiple\nadjustment sets that appear equally plausible. It is often untestable which of\nthese adjustment sets are valid to adjust for (i.e., satisfies ignorability).\nThis discrepancy can pose practical challenges as it is typically unclear how\nto reconcile multiple, possibly conflicting estimates of the average treatment\neffect (ATE). A naive approach is to report the whole range (convex hull of the\nunion) of the resulting confidence intervals. However, the width of this\ninterval might not shrink to zero in large samples and can be unnecessarily\nwide in real applications. To address this issue, we propose a summary\nprocedure that generates a single estimate, one confidence interval, and\nidentifies a set of units for which the causal effect estimate remains valid,\nprovided at least one adjustment set is valid. The width of our proposed\nconfidence interval shrinks to zero with sample size at $n^{-1/2}$ rate, unlike\nthe original range which is of constant order. Thus, our assumption-robust\napproach enables reliable causal inference on the ATE even in scenarios where\nmost of the adjustment sets are invalid. Admittedly, this robustness comes at a\ncost: our inferential guarantees apply to a target population close to, but\ndifferent from, the one originally intended. We use synthetic and real-data\nexamples to demonstrate that our proposed procedure provides substantially\ntighter confidence intervals for the ATE as compared to the whole range. In\nparticular, for a real-world dataset on 401(k) retirement plans our method\nproduces a confidence interval 50\\% shorter than the whole range of confidence\nintervals based on multiple adjustment sets.","main_category":"stat.ME","categories":"stat.ME,econ.EM","published":"2025-05-13T16:39:19Z"}

However, there has been minimal attention in\naddressing the ease of synthesis and enabling flexibility to incorporate\ndesired reaction constraints. In this work, we propose a small molecule\ngenerative design framework that enables steerable and granular\nsynthesizability control. Generated molecules satisfy arbitrary multi-parameter\noptimization objectives with predicted synthesis routes containing pre-defined\nallowed reactions, while optionally avoiding others. One can also enforce that\nall reactions belong to a pre-defined set. We show the capability to\nmix-and-match these reaction constraints across the most common medicinal\nchemistry transformations.
