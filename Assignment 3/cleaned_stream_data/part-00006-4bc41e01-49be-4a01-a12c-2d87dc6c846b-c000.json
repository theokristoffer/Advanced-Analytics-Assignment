However, several leakage-abuse attacks have highlighted some security\nvulnerabilities. Recent attacks assumed an attacker's knowledge containing data\n``similar'' to the indexed data. However, this vague assumption is barely\ndiscussed in literature: how likely is it for an attacker to obtain a \"similar\nenough\" data?\n  Our paper provides novel statistical tools usable on any attack in this\nsetting to analyze its sensitivity to data similarity. First, we introduce a\nmathematical model based on statistical estimators to analytically understand\nthe attackers' knowledge and the notion of similarity. Second, we conceive\nstatistical tools to model the influence of the similarity on the attack\naccuracy. We apply our tools on three existing attacks to answer questions such\nas: is similarity the only factor influencing accuracy of a given attack?\nThird, we show that the enforcement of a maximum index size can make the\n``similar-data'' assumption harder to satisfy. In particular, we propose a\nstatistical method to estimate an appropriate maximum size for a given attack\nand dataset. For the best known attack on the Enron dataset, a maximum index\nsize of 200 guarantees (with high probability) the attack accuracy to be below\n5%.","main_category":"cs.CR","categories":"cs.CR","published":"2025-04-14T05:04:25Z"}

However, we\nfind that most social media posts, along with the public sentiment they\nreflect, provide limited value for trading predictions due to their noisy\nnature. To tackle this, we propose a novel dynamic expert tracing algorithm\nthat filters out non-informative posts and identifies both true and inverse\nexperts whose consistent predictions can serve as valuable trading signals. Our\napproach achieves significant improvements over existing expert identification\nmethods in stock trend prediction. However, when using binary expert\npredictions to predict the return ratio, similar to all other expert\nidentification methods, our approach faces a common challenge of signal\nsparsity with expert signals cover only about 4% of all stock-day combinations\nin our dataset. To address this challenge, we propose a dual graph attention\nneural network that effectively propagates expert signals across related\nstocks, enabling accurate prediction of return ratios and significantly\nincreasing signal coverage. Empirical results show that our propagated\nexpert-based signals not only exhibit strong predictive power independently but\nalso work synergistically with traditional financial features. These combined\nsignals significantly outperform representative baseline models in all\nquant-related metrics including predictive accuracy, return metrics, and\ncorrelation metrics, resulting in more robust investment strategies.

A classic GCL-based method typically uses data augmentation during\ngraph convolution to generates more contrastive views, and performs contrast on\nthese new views to obtain rich self-supervised signals. Despite this paradigm\nis effective, the reasons behind the performance gains remain a mystery. In\nthis paper, we first reveal via theoretical derivation that the gradient\ndescent process of the CL objective is formally equivalent to graph\nconvolution, which implies that CL objective inherently supports neighborhood\naggregation on interaction graphs. We further substantiate this capability\nthrough experimental validation and identify common misconceptions in the\nselection of positive samples in previous methods, which limit the potential of\nCL objective.

Despite this growing interest,\nthere remains a lack of a large-scale, comprehensive dataset and evaluation\nbenchmark with fine-grained annotations tailored to assess the OOD\ngeneralization on more intricate tasks like object detection and grounding. To\naddress this gap, we introduce COUNTS, a large-scale OOD dataset with\nobject-level annotations. COUNTS encompasses 14 natural distributional shifts,\nover 222K samples, and more than 1,196K labeled bounding boxes. Leveraging\nCOUNTS, we introduce two novel benchmarks: O(OD)2 and OODG. O(OD)2 is designed\nto comprehensively evaluate the OOD generalization capabilities of object\ndetectors by utilizing controlled distribution shifts between training and\ntesting data. OODG, on the other hand, aims to assess the OOD generalization of\ngrounding abilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our findings\nreveal that, while large models and extensive pre-training data substantially\nen hance performance in in-distribution (IID) scenarios, significant\nlimitations and opportunities for improvement persist in OOD contexts for both\nobject detectors and MLLMs. In visual grounding tasks, even the advanced GPT-4o\nand Gemini-1.5 only achieve 56.7% and 28.0% accuracy, respectively. We hope\nCOUNTS facilitates advancements in the development and assessment of robust\nobject detectors and MLLMs capable of maintaining high performance under\ndistributional shifts.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-14T12:13:33Z"}

Beyond the traditional 3D\nperovskites, low-dimensional counterparts have more attractive effects such as\nexcitonic emissions and quantum confinements that are enhanced by the reduced\ndimensionality, which involve the Electron-Phonon Coupling (EPC). Such\nphenomenon, which comprehends the interaction between charge carriers and\nlattice vibrations, usually strongly impacts the photoluminescence (PL)\nresponse in low-dimensional frameworks. In this paper, we investigated the\nintrinsic EPC onto low-temperature PL of the zero-dimensional (0D) Rb2SnBr6\nperovskite. Temperature-dependent PL measurements, complemented by various\ncharacterization techniques and theoretical calculations, revealed broadband\nemission with a significant Stokes shift attributed to self-trapped excitons\n(STEs). The Fr\\\"ohlich mechanism, mediated by interactions between excitonic\ncharge carriers and longitudinal optical (LO) phonons, primarily accounts for\nthe emission broadening through phonon-assisted radiative recombination. The\nEPC strength was evaluated through the Huang-Rhys factor S=34, confirming\nstrong correlations between electronic and vibrational properties and\nsupporting the STE emission assumption. The possible mechanism of STE formation\nwas evaluated by the Fr\\\"ohlich parameter {\\alpha} of 1.94 for electrons and\n4.73 for holes, which points out a major contribution of the hole-polaron\nquasi-particle on exciton trapping. Our findings give insights regarding the\ninfluence of EPC in 0D perovskites and STE formation, which leads to the\nassessment of Rb2SnBr6 for light-harvesting applications.","main_category":"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","categories":"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","published":"2025-04-14T15:03:40Z"}

Although\nextensive research has explored their resulting functions and behaviors, the\nunderlying computations often remain elusive. Even the fundamental task of\nquantifying the \\textit{amount} of computation performed by a dynamical system\nremains under-investigated. In this study we address this challenge by\nintroducing a novel framework to estimate the amount of computation implemented\nby an arbitrary physical system based on empirical time-series of its dynamics.\nThis framework works by forming a statistical reconstruction of that dynamics,\nand then defining the amount of computation in terms of both the complexity and\nfidelity of this reconstruction.

However, different defenses target different\nclasses of attacks, and their impact on each other has not been fully\nconsidered. To raise awareness of this problem, we study an interaction between\ntwo state-of-the art defenses in this paper, timing obfuscations of remote\ncache lines (TORC) and delaying speculative changes to remote cache lines\n(DSRC). TORC mitigates cache-hit based attacks and DSRC mitigates speculative\ncoherence state change attacks.\n  We observe that DSRC enables coherence information to be retrieved into the\nprocessor core, where it is out of the reach of timing obfuscations to protect.\nThis creates an unforeseen consequence that redo operations can be triggered\nwithin the core to detect the presence or absence of remote cache lines, which\nconstitutes a security vulnerability.

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10389v1","title":"Diversity-Fair Online Selection","summary":"Online selection problems frequently arise in applications such as\ncrowdsourcing and employee recruitment. Existing research typically focuses on\ncandidates with a single attribute. However, crowdsourcing tasks often require\ncontributions from individuals across various demographics. Further motivated\nby the dynamic nature of crowdsourcing and hiring, we study the diversity-fair\nonline selection problem, in which a recruiter must make real-time decisions to\nfoster workforce diversity across many dimensions. We propose two scenarios for\nthis problem. The fixed-capacity scenario, suited for short-term hiring for\ncrowdsourced workers, provides the recruiter with a fixed capacity to fill\ntemporary job vacancies. In contrast, in the unknown-capacity scenario,\nrecruiters optimize diversity across recruitment seasons with increasing\ncapacities, reflecting that the firm honors diversity consideration in a\nlong-term employee acquisition strategy. By modeling the diversity over $d$\ndimensions as a max-min fairness objective, we show that no policy can surpass\na competitive ratio of $O(1/d^{1/3})$ for either scenario, indicating that any\nachievable result inevitably decays by some polynomial factor in $d$. To this\nend, we develop bilevel hierarchical randomized policies that ensure compliance\nwith the capacity constraint. For the fixed-capacity scenario, leveraging\nmarginal information about the arriving population allows us to achieve a\ncompetitive ratio of $1/(4\\sqrt{d} \\lceil \\log_2 d \\rceil)$. For the\nunknown-capacity scenario, we establish a competitive ratio of\n$\\Omega(1/d^{3/4})$ under mild boundedness conditions. In both bilevel\nhierarchical policies, the higher level determines ex-ante selection\nprobabilities and then informs the lower level's randomized selection that\nensures no loss in efficiency. Both policies prioritize core diversity and then\nadjust for underrepresented dimensions.","main_category":"econ.TH","categories":"econ.TH,cs.DS,math.OC","published":"2025-04-14T16:35:20Z"}

In\nparticular, the study of integrals-of-motion (IoM) space has proven to be\nhighly insightful for uncovering these ancient mergers and understanding their\nimpact on the Galaxy's evolution.\n  Aims. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of a state-of-the-art method for\ndetecting debris from accreted galaxies, by testing it on four Milky Way-like\ngalaxies from the Auriga suite of cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical\nsimulations.\n  Methods. We employ the innovative method from L\\\"ovdal et al. (2022) to\nidentify substructures in the integrals-of-motion space within the local\nstellar halos of the four simulated galaxies. This approach enables us to\nevaluate the method's performance by comparing the properties of the identified\nclusters with the known populations of accreted galaxies in the simulations.\nAdditionally, we investigate whether incorporating chemical abundances and\nstellar age information can help to link distinct structures originating from\nthe same accretion event.\n  Results. This method is very effective in detecting debris from accretion\nevents that occur less than 6-7 Gyr ago but struggles to detect most of the\ndebris from older accretion. Furthermore, most of the detected structures\nsuffer from significant contamination by in-situ stars. Our results also show\nthat the method may also generate artificial detections.\n  Conclusions.

However, some recent structural results on\nthe combinatorial list decoding of randomly punctured Reed-Solomon codes\nsuggest that Johnson bound can likely be broken for some subclasses of RS\ncodes. Motivated by these results, we seek to make traction on understanding\nadversarial decoding by considering a new model: semi-adversarial errors. This\nerror model bridges between fully random errors and fully adversarial errors by\nallowing some symbols of a message to be corrupted by an adversary while others\nare replaced with uniformly random symbols.\n  As our main quest, we seek to understand optimal efficient unique decoding\nalgorithms in the semi-adversarial model. In particular, we revisit some\nclassical results on decoding interleaved Reed-Solomon codes (aka subfield\nevaluation RS codes) in the random error model by Bleichenbacher-Kiayias-Yung\n(BKY) and work to improve and extend their analysis. First, we give an improved\nimplementation and analysis of the BKY algorithm for interleaved Reed-Solomon\ncodes in the semi-adversarial model. In particular, our algorithm runs in\nnear-linear time, and for most mixtures of random and adversarial errors, our\nanalysis matches the information-theoretic optimum.\n  Moreover, inspired by the BKY algorithm, we use a novel interpolation to\nextend our approach to the settings of folded Reed-Solomon codes, resulting in\nfast algorithms for unique decoding against semi-adversarial errors. A\nparticular advantage of our near-linear time algorithm over state-of-the-art\ndecoding algorithms for adversarial errors is that its running time depends\nonly on a polynomial function of the folding parameter rather than on an\nexponential function.","main_category":"cs.IT","categories":"cs.IT,cs.DS,math.IT","published":"2025-04-14T16:49:45Z"}

In this paper, we propose an uplink assisted\njoint CE and and CSI feedback approach via deep learning for downlink CSI\nacquisition, which mitigates performance degradation caused by distribution\nbias across separately trained modules in traditional modular communication\nframeworks. The proposed network adopts a deep joint source-channel coding\n(DJSCC) architecture to mitigate the cliff effect encountered in the\nconventional separate source-channel coding. Furthermore, we exploit the uplink\nCSI as auxiliary information to enhance CSI reconstruction accuracy by\nleveraging the partial reciprocity between the uplink and downlink channels in\nFDD systems, without introducing additional overhead. The effectiveness of\nuplink CSI as assisted information and the necessity of an end-toend\nmulti-module joint training architecture is validated through comprehensive\nablation and scalability experiments.","main_category":"eess.SP","categories":"eess.SP,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-15T03:29:24Z"}

However, due to the high stochasticity\nof meteorological factors (e.g., wind speed) and significant fluctuations in\nwind power output, mid-term wind power forecasting faces a dual challenge of\nmaintaining high accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these\nissues, this paper proposes an efficient and lightweight mid-term wind power\nforecasting model, termed Fast-Powerformer.

These improvements enable the model to strengthen temporal feature\nextraction, optimize dependency modeling across variables, significantly reduce\ncomputational complexity, and enhance sensitivity to periodic patterns and\ndominant frequency components. Experimental results conducted on multiple\nreal-world wind farm datasets demonstrate that the proposed Fast-Powerformer\nachieves superior prediction accuracy and operational efficiency compared to\nmainstream forecasting approaches.

Here, we present a strategy to actively tune Marangoni-driven\nself-emulsification at liquid-liquid interfaces by harnessing fluid\nviscoelasticity. When a water-alcohol droplet spreads on an oil bath, a radial\nsurface tension gradient induced by selective alcohol evaporation drives an\ninterfacial instability, leading to the spontaneous formation of a dense\ntwo-dimensional array of \"daughter\" droplets.

While this can be\nacceptable for use cases where specific user templates are not predetermined,\nit represents a missed opportunity to enhance security in scenarios where\nintegrating PAD with the fingerprint verification system could significantly\nleverage users' templates, which are the real target of a potential\npresentation attack. This does not mean that a PAD should be specifically\ndesigned for such users; that would imply the availability of many enrolled\nusers' PAI and, consequently, complexity, time, and cost increase. On the\ncontrary, we propose to equip a basic PAD, designed according to the state of\nthe art, with an innovative add-on module called the Closeness Binary Code (CC)\nmodule. The term \"closeness\" refers to a peculiar property of the bona\nfide-related features: in an Euclidean feature space, genuine fingerprints tend\nto cluster in a specific pattern. First, samples from the same finger are close\nto each other, then samples from other fingers of the same user and finally,\nsamples from fingers of other users. This property is statistically verified in\nour previous publication, and further confirmed in this paper. It is\nindependent of the user population and the feature set class, which can be\nhandcrafted or deep network-based (embeddings). Therefore, the add-on can be\ndesigned without the need for the targeted user samples; moreover, it exploits\nher/his samples' \"closeness\" property during the verification stage.

The rapid fading of the initial materials required an\nunsustainable repainting rate, burdening volunteers. Lifetime simulations based\non a collections demography framework suggest that repainting efforts must\ncontinue at a rate of some hundreds of hearts per week to maintain a stable\npercentage of hearts in good condition. This finding highlights the need for a\nsustainable management strategy that includes regular maintenance or further\nreduction of the fading rate.\n  Methodologically, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using a\ncollections demography approach, supported by citizen science and social media\ndata, to inform heritage management decisions. An agent-based simulation is\nused to propagate the multiple uncertainties measured. The methodology provides\na robust basis for modeling and decision-making, even in a case like this,\nwhere reliance on publicly available images and volunteer-collected data\nintroduces variability. Future studies could improve data within a citizen\nscience framework by inviting public submissions, using on-site calibration\ncharts, and increasing volunteer involvement for longitudinal data collection.\nThis research illustrates the flexibility of the collections demography\nframework, firstly by showing its applicability to an outdoor monument, which\nis very different from the published case studies, and secondly by\ndemonstrating how it can work even with low-quality data.","main_category":"cs.CY","categories":"cs.CY","published":"2025-04-15T13:51:14Z"}

While recent\nmethods estimate part poses and sizes at the category level, they often rely on\ngeometric cues and complex multi-stage pipelines that first segment parts from\nthe point cloud, followed by Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) estimation\nfor 6D poses. These approaches overlook dense semantic cues from RGB images,\nleading to suboptimal accuracy, particularly for objects with small parts. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a single-stage Network, CAP-Net, for\nestimating the 6D poses and sizes of Categorical Articulated Parts. This method\ncombines RGB-D features to generate instance segmentation and NPCS\nrepresentations for each part in an end-to-end manner. CAP-Net uses a unified\nnetwork to simultaneously predict point-wise class labels, centroid offsets,\nand NPCS maps. A clustering algorithm then groups points of the same predicted\nclass based on their estimated centroid distances to isolate each part.\nFinally, the NPCS region of each part is aligned with the point cloud to\nrecover its final pose and size.

Building on the theories\nof quantum statistical sufficiency and quantum Bayesian retrodiction, we\ncharacterize macroscopic states through several equivalent formulations,\nranging from algebraic to explicitly constructive.

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12739v1","title":"Mask Image Watermarking","summary":"We present MaskMark, a simple, efficient and flexible framework for image\nwatermarking. MaskMark has two variants: MaskMark-D, which supports global\nwatermark embedding, watermark localization, and local watermark extraction for\napplications such as tamper detection, and MaskMark-ED, which focuses on local\nwatermark embedding and extraction with enhanced robustness in small regions,\nenabling localized image protection. Built upon the classical Encoder-\nDistortion-Decoder training paradigm, MaskMark-D introduces a simple masking\nmechanism during the decoding stage to support both global and local watermark\nextraction. A mask is applied to the watermarked image before extraction,\nallowing the decoder to focus on selected regions and learn local extraction. A\nlocalization module is also integrated into the decoder to identify watermark\nregions during inference, reducing interference from irrelevant content and\nimproving accuracy. MaskMark-ED extends this design by incorporating the mask\ninto the encoding stage as well, guiding the encoder to embed the watermark in\ndesignated local regions for enhanced robustness. Comprehensive experiments\nshow that MaskMark achieves state-of-the-art performance in global watermark\nextraction, local watermark extraction, watermark localization, and\nmulti-watermark embedding. It outperforms all existing baselines, including the\nrecent leading model WAM for local watermarking, while preserving high visual\nquality of the watermarked images. MaskMark is also flexible, by adjusting the\ndistortion layer, it can adapt to different robustness requirements with just a\nfew steps of fine-tuning. Moreover, our approach is efficient and easy to\noptimize, requiring only 20 hours on a single A6000 GPU with just 1/15 the\ncomputational cost of WAM.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-17T08:29:00Z"}

Given that object information in\nimages plays a far more crucial role in downstream tasks than background\ninformation, some studies have proposed semantically structuring the bitstream\nto selectively transmit and reconstruct only the information required by these\ntasks. However, such methods structure the bitstream after encoding, meaning\nthat the coding process still relies on the entire image, even though much of\nthe encoded information will not be transmitted. This leads to redundant\ncomputations. Traditional image compression methods require a two-dimensional\nimage as input, and even if the unimportant regions of the image are set to\nzero by applying a semantic mask, these regions still participate in subsequent\ncomputations as part of the image.

To address this, we introduce RoboTwin, a generative digital\ntwin framework that uses 3D generative foundation models and large language\nmodels to produce diverse expert datasets and provide a real-world-aligned\nevaluation platform for dual-arm robotic tasks. Specifically, RoboTwin creates\nvaried digital twins of objects from single 2D images, generating realistic and\ninteractive scenarios. It also introduces a spatial relation-aware code\ngeneration framework that combines object annotations with large language\nmodels to break down tasks, determine spatial constraints, and generate precise\nrobotic movement code. Our framework offers a comprehensive benchmark with both\nsimulated and real-world data, enabling standardized evaluation and better\nalignment between simulated training and real-world performance. We validated\nour approach using the open-source COBOT Magic Robot platform. Policies\npre-trained on RoboTwin-generated data and fine-tuned with limited real-world\nsamples demonstrate significant potential for enhancing dual-arm robotic\nmanipulation systems by improving success rates by over 70% for single-arm\ntasks and over 40% for dual-arm tasks compared to models trained solely on\nreal-world data.","main_category":"cs.RO","categories":"cs.RO,cs.AI,cs.CL","published":"2025-04-17T16:14:24Z"}

As standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like mean-field theory fails\nto capture any superconducting state, we explain this using an effective\nfractionalized field theory involving fermionic chargeons, bosonic colorons and\nan emergent U(1) gauge field.

An analogy can be\ndrawn between re-ranking and the dynamics of economic transactions. The\naccuracy-fairness trade-off parallels the coupling of the commodity tax\ntransfer process. Fairness considerations in re-ranking, similar to a commodity\ntax on suppliers, ultimately translate into a cost passed on to consumers.\nAnalogously, item-side fairness constraints result in a decline in user-side\naccuracy.

However, the collection and\nanalysis of user-generated stream data raise privacy concerns due to the\npotential exposure of sensitive information. To address these concerns, local\ndifferential privacy (LDP) has emerged as a promising standard. Nevertheless,\napplying LDP to stream data presents significant challenges, as stream data\noften involves a large or even infinite number of values. Allocating a given\nprivacy budget across these data points would introduce overwhelming LDP noise\nto the original stream data.\n  Beyond existing approaches that merely use perturbed values for estimating\nstatistics, our design leverages them for both perturbation and estimation.\nThis dual utilization arises from a key observation: each user knows their own\nground truth and perturbed values, enabling a precise computation of the\ndeviation error caused by perturbation. By incorporating this deviation into\nthe perturbation process of subsequent values, the previous noise can be\ncalibrated. Following this insight, we introduce the Iterative Perturbation\nParameterization (IPP) method, which utilizes current perturbed results to\ncalibrate the subsequent perturbation process.

Due to the lack of localization labels, the de facto standard\nin SSL has been to represent an image and audio as a single embedding vector\neach, and use them to learn SSL via contrastive learning. To this end, previous\nwork samples one of local image features as the image embedding and aggregates\nall local audio features to obtain the audio embedding, which is far from\noptimal due to the presence of noise and background irrelevant to the actual\ntarget in the input. We present a novel SSL method that addresses this chronic\nissue by joint slot attention on image and audio. To be specific, two slots\ncompetitively attend image and audio features to decompose them into target and\noff-target representations, and only target representations of image and audio\nare used for contrastive learning. Also, we introduce cross-modal attention\nmatching to further align local features of image and audio.

Recent multi-modal approaches have shown promise in improving FFIA\nrobustness and efficiency. However, these methods face significant challenges\nwhen adapting to new fish species or environments due to catastrophic\nforgetting and the lack of suitable datasets. To address these limitations, we\nfirst introduce AV-CIL-FFIA, a new dataset comprising 81,932 labelled\naudio-visual clips capturing feeding intensities across six different fish\nspecies in real aquaculture environments. Then, we pioneer audio-visual class\nincremental learning (CIL) for FFIA and demonstrate through benchmarking on\nAV-CIL-FFIA that it significantly outperforms single-modality methods. Existing\nCIL methods rely heavily on historical data. Exemplar-based approaches store\nraw samples, creating storage challenges, while exemplar-free methods avoid\ndata storage but struggle to distinguish subtle feeding intensity variations\nacross different fish species. To overcome these limitations, we introduce\nHAIL-FFIA, a novel audio-visual class-incremental learning framework that\nbridges this gap with a prototype-based approach that achieves exemplar-free\nefficiency while preserving essential knowledge through compact feature\nrepresentations.

The proposed method adapts implicit shock tracking\nmethods, originally developed to align mesh faces with solution\ndiscontinuities, to compress elements into viscous shocks and boundary layers,\nfunctioning as a novel approach to aggressive $r$-adaptation. This form of\n$r$-adaptation is achieved naturally as the minimizer of the enriched residual\nwith respect to the discrete flow variables and coordinates of the nodes of the\ngrid.

Existing methods commonly\nemploy the thin plate spline (TPS) transformation or appearance flow to deform\nin-shop clothing for aligning with the person's body. Despite their promising\nperformance, these methods often lack precise control over fine details,\nleading to inconsistencies in shape between clothing and the person's body as\nwell as distortions in exposed limb regions. To tackle these challenges, we\npropose a novel shape-guided clothing warping method for virtual try-on, dubbed\nSCW-VTON, which incorporates global shape constraints and additional limb\ntextures to enhance the realism and consistency of the warped clothing and\ntry-on results. To integrate global shape constraints for clothing warping, we\ndevise a dual-path clothing warping module comprising a shape path and a flow\npath. The former path captures the clothing shape aligned with the person's\nbody, while the latter path leverages the mapping between the pre- and\npost-deformation of the clothing shape to guide the estimation of appearance\nflow. Furthermore, to alleviate distortions in limb regions of try-on results,\nwe integrate detailed limb guidance by developing a limb reconstruction network\nbased on masked image modeling. Through the utilization of SCW-VTON, we are\nable to generate try-on results with enhanced clothing shape consistency and\nprecise control over details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority\nof our approach over state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and\nquantitatively.

In our\nwork, we seek to invert the weak lensing signal from 2D telescope images to\nreconstruct a 3D map of the universe's dark matter field. While inversion\ntypically yields a 2D projection of the dark matter field, accurate 3D maps of\nthe dark matter distribution are essential for localizing structures of\ninterest and testing theories of our universe. However, 3D inversion poses\nsignificant challenges. First, unlike standard 3D reconstruction that relies on\nmultiple viewpoints, in this case, images are only observed from a single\nviewpoint. This challenge can be partially addressed by observing how galaxy\nemitters throughout the volume are lensed. However, this leads to the second\nchallenge: the shapes and exact locations of unlensed galaxies are unknown, and\ncan only be estimated with a very large degree of uncertainty. This introduces\nan overwhelming amount of noise which nearly drowns out the lensing signal\ncompletely. Previous approaches tackle this by imposing strong assumptions\nabout the structures in the volume. We instead propose a methodology using a\ngravitationally-constrained neural field to flexibly model the continuous\nmatter distribution. We take an analysis-by-synthesis approach, optimizing the\nweights of the neural network through a fully differentiable physical forward\nmodel to reproduce the lensing signal present in image measurements.

Existing methods primarily\ntransfer traditional AF methods to encrypted tunnels directly, ignoring the\ncore obfuscation and re-encapsulation mechanism of encrypted tunnels, thus\nresulting in unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose DecETT, a\ndual decouple-based semantic enhancement method for accurate AF under encrypted\ntunnels. Specifically, DecETT improves AF under encrypted tunnels from two\nperspectives: app-specific feature enhancement and irrelevant tunnel feature\ndecoupling.Considering the obfuscated app-specific information in encrypted\ntunnel traffic, DecETT introduces TLS traffic with stronger app-specific\ninformation as a semantic anchor to guide and enhance the fingerprint\ngeneration for tunnel traffic. Furthermore, to address the app-irrelevant\ntunnel feature introduced by the re-encapsulation mechanism, DecETT is designed\nwith a dual decouple-based fingerprint enhancement module, which decouples the\ntunnel feature and app semantic feature from tunnel traffic separately, thereby\nminimizing the impact of tunnel features on accurate app fingerprint\nextraction. Evaluation under five prevalent encrypted tunnels indicates that\nDecETT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accurate AF under encrypted\ntunnels, and further demonstrates its superiority under tunnels with more\ncomplicated obfuscation. \\textit{Project page:\n\\href{https://github.com/DecETT/DecETT}{https://github.com/DecETT/DecETT}}","main_category":"cs.CR","categories":"cs.CR","published":"2025-04-22T03:34:22Z"}

A natural\nquestion to ask is, can the leader improve their strategy by learning about the\nunknown follower through repeated interactions? A well known folk theorem from\ndynamic pricing, a special case of this leader-follower setting, would suggest\nthat the leader cannot learn effectively from the follower when the follower is\nfully strategic, leading to a large literature on learning in strategic\nsettings that relies on limiting the strategic space of the follower in order\nto provide positive results. In this paper, we study dynamic Bayesian\nStackelberg games, where a leader and a \\emph{fully strategic} follower\ninteract repeatedly, with the follower's type unknown. Contrary to existing\nresults, we show that the leader can improve their utility through learning in\nrepeated play. Using a novel average-case analysis, we demonstrate that\nlearning is effective in these settings, without needing to weaken the\nfollower's strategic space. Importantly, this improvement is not solely due to\nthe leader's ability to commit, nor does learning simply substitute for\ncommunication between the parties.

However, the unique properties of hyperspectral data, such as high\ndimensionality and feature inlining, pose challenges to the application of\nMamba to HSI classification. To compensate for these shortcomings, we propose\nan full-field interaction multi-groups Mamba framework (HS-Mamba), which adopts\na strategy different from pixel-patch based or whole-image based, but combines\nthe advantages of both. The patches cut from the whole image are sent to\nmulti-groups Mamba, combined with positional information to perceive local\ninline features in the spatial and spectral domains, and the whole image is\nsent to a lightweight attention module to enhance the global feature\nrepresentation ability. Specifically, HS-Mamba consists of a dual-channel\nspatial-spectral encoder (DCSS-encoder) module and a lightweight global inline\nattention (LGI-Att) branch. The DCSS-encoder module uses multiple groups of\nMamba to decouple and model the local features of dual-channel sequences with\nnon-overlapping patches. The LGI-Att branch uses a lightweight compressed and\nextended attention module to perceive the global features of the spatial and\nspectral domains of the unsegmented whole image.

Since\nworkers are typically unwilling to provide training services/models freely and\nvoluntarily, many incentive mechanisms in FL are designed to incentivize\nparticipation by offering monetary rewards from requesters. However, existing\nstudies neglect two crucial aspects of real-world FL scenarios. First, workers\ncan possess inherent incompatibility characteristics (e.g., communication\nchannels and data sources), which can lead to degradation of FL efficiency\n(e.g., low communication efficiency and poor model generalization). Second, the\nrequesters are budgeted, which limits the amount of workers they can hire for\ntheir tasks.

To address efficiency\ndegradation caused by worker incompatibility, we develop novel\ncompatibility-aware incentive mechanisms, CARE-CO and CARE-NO, for both\nsettings to elicit true private costs and determine workers to hire for\nrequesters and their rewards while satisfying requester budget constraints.

We interprete this high energy neutrino event\nresults from the Dirac fermion dark matter (DM) $\\chi$ decay through the\nright-handed (RH) neutrino portal assuming the Type-I seesaw mechanism for\nneutrino masses and mixings. Fruthermore, dark matter $\\chi$ is assumed to\ncharged under $U(1)_X$ dark gauge symmetry, which is sponetaneously broken by\nthe vacuum expectation value of the dark Higgs $\\Phi$.

If the DM mass is around $440$ PeV with a lifetime\n$5\\times 10^{29}$ sec, it can account for the KM3-230213A event.

Finally, the large value of the dark Higgs field VEV opens up the\npossibility of generating GW spectra from cosmic strings.

A dynamical steady\nstate is reached where the network is dynamically swelled for force monopoles.\nThe time-averaged mean square displacement (MSD) shows sub-diffusive behavior\nat intermediate times longer than the force correlation time, whose anomalous\nexponent is solely controlled by the spectral dimension $(d_s)$ of the fractal\nnetwork yielding MSD $\\sim t^{\\nu}$, with $\\nu=1-\\frac{d_s}{2}$, similar to the\nthermal system and in accord with the general analytic theory. In contrast,\ndipolar forces require a diverging time to reach a steady state, depending on\nthe fraction of dipoles, and lead to network shrinkage. Within a\nquasi-steady-state assumption, we find a saturation behavior at the same\ntemporal regime. Thereafter, a second ballistic-like rise is observed for\nnetworks with a low fraction of dipole forces, followed by a linear, diffusive\nincrease. The second ballistic rise is, however, absent in networks fully\noccupied with force dipoles. These two behaviors are argued to result from\nlocal rotations of nodes, which are either persistent or fluctuating.","main_category":"cond-mat.soft","categories":"cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.stat-mech","published":"2025-04-23T08:36:34Z"}

Although numerical methods to calculateMHS solutions can deal with\nnon-linear problems and hence provide more accurate models, analytical\nthree-dimensional MHS equilibria can also be used as a numerically relatively\n\"cheap\" complementary method. In this paper, we present an extrapolation method\nbased on a family of analytical MHS equilibria that allows for a transition\nfrom a non-force-free region to a force-free region. We demonstrate how\nasymptotic forms of the solutions can help to increase the numerical efficiency\nof the method.

Broadly, self-supervised methods fall into two types: 1)\nContrastive methods, such as SimCLR; and 2) Non-Contrastive methods, such as\nBYOL. Contrastive methods are generally trying to maximize mutual information\nbetween related data points, so they need to compare every data point to every\nother data point, resulting in high variance, and thus requiring large batch\nsizes to work well.

To ensure that only tensile stresses and not compressive stresses\ndrive crack growth, several models have been proposed that aim to distinguish\nbetween compressive and tensile loads. However, these models have a critical\nshortcoming: they do not account for the crack direction, and hence they cannot\ndistinguish between crack-normal tensile stresses that drive crack growth and\ncrack-parallel stresses that do not.\n  In this study, we apply a phase-field fracture model, developed in our\nearlier work, that uses the crack direction to distinguish crack-parallel\nstresses from crack-normal stresses.

Existing approaches fall\ninto two categories: keyframe-based strategies, which predict gripper poses in\nkeyframes and execute them via motion planners, and continuous control methods,\nwhich estimate actions sequentially at each timestep. The keyframe-based method\nlacks inter-frame supervision, struggling to perform consistently or execute\ncurved motions, while the continuous method suffers from weaker spatial\nperception. To address these issues, this paper introduces an end-to-end\nframework PPI (keyPose and Pointflow Interface), which integrates the\nprediction of target gripper poses and object pointflow with the continuous\nactions estimation. These interfaces enable the model to effectively attend to\nthe target manipulation area, while the overall framework guides diverse and\ncollision-free trajectories. By combining interface predictions with continuous\nactions estimation, PPI demonstrates superior performance in diverse bimanual\nmanipulation tasks, providing enhanced spatial localization and satisfying\nflexibility in handling movement restrictions. In extensive evaluations, PPI\nsignificantly outperforms prior methods in both simulated and real-world\nexperiments, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a +16.1% improvement\non the RLBench2 simulation benchmark and an average of +27.5% gain across four\nchallenging real-world tasks.

Standard deep\nlearning models often struggle with these challenges because their\narchitectures inherently smooth over fine-grained fluctuations while focusing\non general trends. This limitation arises from low-pass filtering effects, gate\nbiases favoring stability, and memory update mechanisms that prioritize\nlong-term information retention. To address these shortcomings, this study\nintroduces a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates both long-term\ntrend and short-term fluctuation information using two input features processed\nin parallel, designed to capture complementary aspects of traffic flow\ndynamics. Further, our approach leverages attention mechanisms, specifically\nBahdanau attention, to selectively focus on critical time steps within traffic\ndata, enhancing the model's ability to predict congestion and other transient\nphenomena. Experimental results demonstrate that features learned from both\nbranches are complementary, significantly improving the goodness-of-fit\nstatistics across multiple prediction horizons compared to a baseline model.\nNotably, the attention mechanism enhances short-term forecast accuracy by\ndirectly targeting immediate fluctuations, though challenges remain in fully\nintegrating long-term trends.

With detections of carbon- and\noxygen-bearing species such as CO, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, and H$_2$O, a central\nquestion is whether the atmospheric C/O ratio, commonly used to trace formation\nlocation in giant planets, can serve a similar diagnostic role for\nsub-Neptunes. We use the global chemical equilibrium framework of Schlichting &\nYoung (2022) to quantify how magma ocean-atmosphere interactions affect the\natmospheric C/O ratio. We find that the resulting C/O ratios range from several\norders of magnitude below solar to a few times solar. The atmospheric C/O ratio\nin sub-Neptunes is therefore not inherited from the protoplanetary disk, but\ninstead emerges from chemical equilibrium between the atmosphere and the\nunderlying magma ocean. Planetary mass, atmospheric mass fraction, and thermal\nstate all strongly influence the atmospheric C/O ratio. In addition, carbon\npartitioning into the metal phase typically reduces the atmospheric C/O ratio\nsubstantially, particularly for atmospheric mass fractions less than a few\npercent. Finally, we couple the deep equilibrium compositions to 1D atmospheric\nmodels that self-consistently solve for the pressure-temperature structure and\nchemical composition, including photochemistry.

This\npaper discusses the vulnerability of LVLMs in solving counterfactual\npresupposition questions (CPQs), where the models are prone to accept the\npresuppositions of counterfactual objects and produce severe hallucinatory\nresponses. To this end, we introduce \"Antidote\", a unified, synthetic\ndata-driven post-training framework for mitigating both types of hallucination\nabove. It leverages synthetic data to incorporate factual priors into questions\nto achieve self-correction, and decouple the mitigation process into a\npreference optimization problem. Furthermore, we construct \"CP-Bench\", a novel\nbenchmark to evaluate LVLMs' ability to correctly handle CPQs and produce\nfactual responses. Applied to the LLaVA series, Antidote can simultaneously\nenhance performance on CP-Bench by over 50%, POPE by 1.8-3.3%, and CHAIR & SHR\nby 30-50%, all without relying on external supervision from stronger LVLMs or\nhuman feedback and introducing noticeable catastrophic forgetting issues.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-29T07:05:24Z"}

A key challenge is achieving\nrobust generalization across domains, ensuring stable performance even when the\nsensing environment changes significantly. This paper introduces a novel deep\nlearning model for cross-domain adaptation of Wi-Fi signals, inspired by\nphysical signal shielding. The model uses a Relativistic average Generative\nAdversarial Network (RaGAN) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)\narchitectures for both the generator and discriminator. To simulate physical\nshielding, an acrylic box lined with electromagnetic shielding fabric was\nconstructed, mimicking a Faraday cage. Wi-Fi signal spectra were collected from\nvarious materials both inside (domain-free) and outside (domain-dependent) the\nbox to train the model. A multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) was trained\non domain-free spectra and tested on signals denoised by the RaGAN. The system\nachieved 96% accuracy and demonstrated strong material discrimination\ncapabilities, offering potential for use in security applications to identify\nconcealed objects based on their composition.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG","published":"2025-04-29T09:18:02Z"}

When carrying out PEFT under collaborative learning\nscenarios (e.g., federated learning), it is often required to exchange model\nupdates (or gradients) across parties. These gradients, even with limited\ndimensions, can cause severe breach of data privacy. Recent works have shown\nthat both contextual prefixes and personally identifiable information (PII) can\nbe exposed through gradients. However, \\emph{simultaneously} and\n\\emph{accurately} recovering both components from the same training instance\nremains infeasible due to the following challenges: 1) limited number of PEFT\nparameters; 2) high-dimensional token spaces; and 3) large batch sizes.

Currently, most models aim at providing optical\nproperties for dust grains in the diffuse ISM, and many do not account properly\nfor complexity in composition and structure when dust is expected to evolve in\ndense astrophysical environments. Our purpose is to investigate, with a pilot\nsample of micron-size dust grains, the influence of dust structure, porosity,\nand composition when computing the optical properties of grown dust grains in\nthe infrared and millimetre domains, where observations are widely used to\nconstrain the dust properties. Starting from the small dust grains developed in\nthe THEMIS 2.0 model, we use the Discrete Dipole Approximation to compute the\noptical properties of 1 um grains, varying the hypotheses made on their\ncomposition and structure. We look at the dust scattering, emission and\nextinction to isolate potential simplifications and unavoidable differences\nbetween grain structures. We note that both dust structure and porosity\ninfluence the dust properties in infrared and millimetre ranges, demonstrating\nthat dust aggregates cannot be correctly approximated by compact or porous\nspheres.

Therefore, Bohr argues, the mental image proposed by Heisenberg should\nbe avoided. Later developments by Bell and Kochen-Specker shows that a model\nthat contains the features used for the Heisenberg microscope is in principle\npossible but must necessarily be nonlocal and contextual. In this paper we will\nre-examine the measurement process within a restriction of QM known as\nStabilizer QM, that still exhibits for example Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger\nnonlocality and Peres-Mermin contextuality.

We introduce a systematic\nframework for searching codes with specified transversal groups by\nparametrizing their logical subspaces on the Stiefel manifold and minimizing a\ncomposite loss that enforces both the Knill-Laflamme conditions and a target\ntransversal-group structure. Applying this method, we uncover a new $((6,2,3))$\ncode admitting a transversal $Z\\bigl(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{5}\\bigr)$ gate (transversal\ngroup $\\mathrm{C}_{10}$), the smallest known distance $3$ code supporting\nnon-Clifford transversal gates, as well as several new $((7,2,3))$ codes\nrealizing the binary icosahedral group $2I$.

Given the inevitable presence of adversarial attacks in the real\nworld, a variety of defense methods have been proposed to counter these attacks\nand enhance the robustness of GNNs. Despite the commendable performance of\nthese defense methods, we have observed that they tend to exhibit a structural\nbias in terms of their defense capability on nodes with low degree (i.e., tail\nnodes), which is similar to the structural bias of traditional GNNs on nodes\nwith low degree in the clean graph. Therefore, in this work, we propose a\ndefense strategy by including hetero-homo augmented graph construction, $k$NN\naugmented graph construction, and multi-view node-wise attention modules to\nmitigate the structural bias of GNNs against adversarial attacks. Notably, the\nhetero-homo augmented graph consists of removing heterophilic links (i.e.,\nlinks connecting nodes with dissimilar features) globally and adding homophilic\nlinks (i.e., links connecting nodes with similar features) for nodes with low\ndegree.

Understanding these\nejection events unveils new understanding of jet-launching, jet power, and\njet-ISM interaction among other implications. Multi-frequency\nquasi-simultaneous radio observations of ejecta from the black hole XRB MAXI\nJ1820+070 produced both size and calorimetry constraints, which we use as\ninitial conditions of a relativistic hydrodynamic simulation. We qualitatively\nreproduce the observed deceleration of the ejecta in a homogeneous interstellar\nmedium (ISM). Our simulations demonstrate that the ejecta must be denser than\nthe ISM, the ISM be significantly low-density, and the launch be extremely\npowerful, in order to propagate to the observed distances. The blob propagates\nand clears out a high-pressure low-density cavity in its wake, providing an\nexplanation for this pre-existing low-density environment, as well as\n'bubble-like' environments in the vicinity of XRBs inferred from other studies.\nAs the blob decelerates, we observe the onset of instabilities and a long-lived\nreverse shock -- these mechanisms convert kinetic to internal energy in the\nblob, responsible for in-situ particle acceleration. We transform the outputs\nof our simulation into pseudo-radio images, incorporating the u,v coverage of\nthe MeerKAT and e-MERLIN telescopes from the original observations with\nreal-sky background.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel framework Birdie, using a differentiable search\nindex.

The main\nhypothesis is that, after transforming the observations to the unit-Pareto\nscale, their distribution is regularly varying in the sense that the\ndistributions of their radial and angular components (with respect to the\n$L_1$-norm) converge and become asymptotically independent as the radius gets\nlarge.

A reverse transformation is then applied to these values and gives\nsimulated values on the original data scale.

Moreover, any probability space, together with a\nset of its random variables, can be mapped to such a model in a way that gives\neach outcome, event, and random variable a logical interpretation.

There are scenarios that are expressible in this\nsystem of logic which cannot be formulated in a measure-theoretic probability\nmodel.\n  The principle of indifference is an idea originating with Laplace.

We\ninvestigate how high-velocity stellar winds, magnetic fields, and\nmetallicity-dependent radiative cooling influence gas dynamics and black hole\naccretion in compact WR clusters.

In this analysis, it is shown\nthat the presence of neon reduces the influence of drifts on the simulated\nprofiles. In the simulation results, double peaked profiles/profiles with two\nvalleys are observed at the divertor targets which can be explained by the\nparallel drift velocities These drifts move particles from the outboard towards\nthe inboard side and, in that way, also increase the ionization sources at the\ninboard side. It is shown that Ne+ leaks towards the core making it difficult\nto perform experiments which contain as much neon as in the SOLPS-ITER\nsimulations. In fact, the level of neon in the experiments is limited by the HL\nbacktransition which takes place if higher order states of neon ionize in the\ncore and cause in that way too much core radiation. Furthermore, the analysis\nof the radiated power profiles suggests that the presence of other radiators\nbesides neon is important to bring the experiments into detachment. The\nionization of deuterium is the most important neutral reaction present in the\nsimulations.

The compromised model behaves normally on clean\nsamples but misclassifies backdoored samples into the attacker-specified target\nclass, posing a significant threat to real-world DNN applications. Currently,\nseveral empirical defense methods have been proposed to mitigate backdoor\nattacks, but they are often bypassed by more advanced backdoor techniques. In\ncontrast, certified defenses based on randomized smoothing have shown promise\nby adding random noise to training and testing samples to counteract backdoor\nattacks. In this paper, we reveal that existing randomized smoothing defenses\nimplicitly assume that all samples are equidistant from the decision boundary.\nHowever, it may not hold in practice, leading to suboptimal certification\nperformance. To address this issue, we propose a sample-specific certified\nbackdoor defense method, termed Cert-SSB. Cert-SSB first employs stochastic\ngradient ascent to optimize the noise magnitude for each sample, ensuring a\nsample-specific noise level that is then applied to multiple poisoned training\nsets to retrain several smoothed models. After that, Cert-SSB aggregates the\npredictions of multiple smoothed models to generate the final robust\nprediction.

Firstly,\nLLM-iTeach uses a hierarchical prompting strategy that guides the LLM in\ngenerating a policy in Python code. Then, with a designed similarity-based\nfeedback mechanism, LLM-iTeach provides corrective and evaluative feedback\ninteractively during the agent's training. We evaluate LLM-iTeach against\nbaseline methods such as Behavior Cloning (BC), an IL method, and CEILing, a\nstate-of-the-art IIL method using a human teacher, on various robotic\nmanipulation tasks. Our results demonstrate that LLM-iTeach surpasses BC in the\nsuccess rate and achieves or even outscores that of CEILing, highlighting the\npotential of LLMs as cost-effective, human-like teachers in interactive\nlearning environments. We further demonstrate the method's potential for\ngeneralization by evaluating it on additional tasks.

In particular, the kilonova signal following a merger can help\nus elucidate the role of neutron stars in nucleosynthesis, and informs us about\nthe properties of matter above nuclear saturation. Approximate modeling of\nneutrinos remains an important limitation to our ability to make predictions\nfor these observables. Part of the problem is the fermionic nature of\nneutrinos. By the exclusion principle, the expected value $f_\\nu$ for the\nnumber of neutrinos in a quantum state is at most 1. Any process producing\nneutrinos is suppressed by a blocking factor $(1-f_\\nu)$. Recent simulations\nfocused on neutrino physics mostly use a gray two-moment scheme to evolve\nneutrinos. This evolves integrals of $f_\\nu$ over momentum space, preventing\ndirect calculations of blocking factors. Monte Carlo methods may be an\nattractive alternative, providing access to the full distribution of neutrinos.\nTheir current implementation is however inadequate to estimate $f_\\nu$: in our\nmost recent simulations, a single Monte Carlo packet causes, in the worst\ncases, estimates of $f_\\nu$ to jump from $f_\\nu=0$ to $f_\\nu\\sim 10^5$. While\nthis is concerning, this brazen violation of the fermionic nature of neutrinos\nhas been largely inconsequential as the interactions used in simulations avoid\ndirect calculations of $f_\\nu$.

The dynamic nature of this data, characterized by\ncontinuous changes or data drift, poses significant challenges for on-device\nmodels. To address this issue, continual learning (CL) is proposed, enabling\nmachine learning models to incrementally update their knowledge and mitigate\ncatastrophic forgetting. However, the traditional centralized approach to CL is\nunsuitable for end devices due to privacy and data volume concerns. In this\ncontext, federated continual learning (FCL) emerges as a promising solution,\npreserving user data locally while enhancing models through collaborative\nupdates. Aiming at the challenges of limited storage resources for CL, poor\nautonomy in task shift detection, and difficulty in coping with new adversarial\ntasks in FCL scenario, we propose a novel FCL framework named SacFL. SacFL\nemploys an Encoder-Decoder architecture to separate task-robust and\ntask-sensitive components, significantly reducing storage demands by retaining\nlightweight task-sensitive components for resource-constrained end devices.\nMoreover, $\\rm{SacFL}$ leverages contrastive learning to introduce an\nautonomous data shift detection mechanism, enabling it to discern whether a new\ntask has emerged and whether it is a benign task.

Conventional thermal comfort models, such\nas the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), rely on both environmental and personal\nvariables. However, the use of fixed-location sensors limits the ability to\ncapture spatial variability, which reduces the accuracy of occupant-specific\ncomfort estimation. To address this limitation, this study proposes a new PMV\nestimation method that incorporates spatial environmental data reconstructed\nusing the Gappy Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (Gappy POD) algorithm. In\naddition, a group PMV-based control framework is developed to account for the\nthermal comfort of multiple occupants. The Gappy POD method enables fast and\naccurate reconstruction of indoor temperature fields from sparse sensor\nmeasurements. Using these reconstructed fields and occupant location data,\nspatially resolved PMV values are calculated. Group-level thermal conditions\nare then derived through statistical aggregation methods and used to control\nindoor temperature in a multi-occupant living lab environment. Experimental\nresults show that the Gappy POD algorithm achieves an average relative error\nbelow 3\\% in temperature reconstruction. PMV distributions varied by up to 1.26\nscale units depending on occupant location. Moreover, thermal satisfaction\noutcomes varied depending on the group PMV method employed. These findings\nunderscore the importance for adaptive thermal control strategies that\nincorporate both spatial and individual variability, offering valuable insights\nfor future occupant-centric building operations.","main_category":"cs.CE","categories":"cs.CE","published":"2025-05-01T11:43:28Z"}

RIS can be categorized into multiple types based on their\nreflective/transmissive modes and polarization control capabilities, all of\nwhich are expected to be widely deployed in practical environments. A reliable\nRIS channel model is essential for the design and development of RIS\ncommunication systems.

To achieve this, a unified EM response model for the aforementioned RIS\ntypes is developed.

Drawing on the\nGerman philosopher Heidegger's concept of dwelling -- which extends beyond\nphysical presence to encompass meaningful connection to place -- we investigate\nhow people conceptualize and evaluate localness in both human and artificial\nagents. Using a chat-based interaction paradigm inspired by Turing's Imitation\nGame and Von Ahn's Games With A Purpose, we engaged 230 participants in\nconversations designed to examine the cues people rely on to assess local\npresence.

However, they neglect the factor of depth while designing the fusion\nstrategy. In this work, we are the first to observe that different modalities\nplay different roles as depth varies via statistical analysis and\nvisualization. Based on this finding, we propose a Depth-Aware Hybrid Feature\nFusion (DepthFusion) strategy that guides the weights of point cloud and RGB\nimage modalities by introducing depth encoding at both global and local levels.\nSpecifically, the Depth-GFusion module adaptively adjusts the weights of image\nBird's-Eye-View (BEV) features in multi-modal global features via depth\nencoding. Furthermore, to compensate for the information lost when transferring\nraw features to the BEV space, we propose a Depth-LFusion module, which\nadaptively adjusts the weights of original voxel features and multi-view image\nfeatures in multi-modal local features via depth encoding. Extensive\nexperiments on the nuScenes and KITTI datasets demonstrate that our DepthFusion\nmethod surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods.

We examine the influence\nof neutral-ion decoupling and the associated damping of turbulence on CR\npropagation in both transonic and supersonic conditions.

However, past hybrid tutoring applications are\nlimited in guiding tutor attention to students that require support.\nSpecifically, existing conferencing tools, commonly used in hybrid tutoring, do\nnot allow tutors to monitor multiple students' screens while directly\ncommunicating and attending to multiple students simultaneously. To address\nthis issue, this paper introduces VTutor, a web-based platform leveraging\npeer-to-peer screen sharing and virtual avatars to deliver real-time,\ncontext-aware tutoring feedback at scale. By integrating a multi-student\nmonitoring dashboard with AI-powered avatar prompts, VTutor empowers a single\neducator or tutor to rapidly detect off-task or struggling students and\nintervene proactively, thus enhancing the benefits of one-on-one interactions\nin classroom contexts with several students. Drawing on insight from the\nlearning sciences and past research on animated pedagogical agents, we\ndemonstrate how stylized avatars can potentially sustain student engagement\nwhile accommodating varying infrastructure constraints. Finally, we address\nopen questions on refining large-scale, AI-driven tutoring solutions for\nimproved learner outcomes, and how VTutor could help interpret real-time\nlearner interactions to support remote tutors at scale.

This\nsetup, known as positive-unlabeled (PU) learning, is addressed here with a\nnetwork flow-based method which utilizes pairwise similarities between samples.\nThe method we propose here, 2-HNC, leverages Hochbaum's Normalized Cut (HNC)\nand the set of solutions it provides by solving a parametric minimum cut\nproblem. The set of solutions, that are nested partitions of the samples into\ntwo sets, correspond to varying tradeoff values between the two goals: high\nintra-similarity inside the sets and low inter-similarity between the two sets.\nThis nested sequence is utilized here to deliver a ranking of unlabeled samples\nby their likelihood of being negative. Building on this insight, our method,\n2-HNC, proceeds in two stages. The first stage generates this ranking without\nassuming any negative labels, using a problem formulation that is constrained\nonly on positive labeled samples. The second stage augments the positive set\nwith likely-negative samples and recomputes the classification. The final label\nprediction selects among all generated partitions in both stages, the one that\ndelivers a positive class proportion, closest to a prior estimate of this\nquantity, which is assumed to be given.

RL agents are typically trained in a\nfixed set of scenarios and nominal behavior of surrounding road users in\nsimulations, limiting their generalization and real-life deployment. While\ndomain randomization offers a potential solution by randomly sampling driving\nscenarios, it frequently results in inefficient training and sub-optimal\npolicies due to the high variance among training scenarios. To address these\nlimitations, we propose an automatic curriculum learning framework that\ndynamically generates driving scenarios with adaptive complexity based on the\nagent's evolving capabilities. Unlike manually designed curricula that\nintroduce expert bias and lack scalability, our framework incorporates a\n``teacher'' that automatically generates and mutates driving scenarios based on\ntheir learning potential -- an agent-centric metric derived from the agent's\ncurrent policy -- eliminating the need for expert design. The framework\nenhances training efficiency by excluding scenarios the agent has mastered or\nfinds too challenging. We evaluate our framework in a reinforcement learning\nsetting where the agent learns a driving policy from camera images. Comparative\nresults against baseline methods, including fixed scenario training and domain\nrandomization, demonstrate that our approach leads to enhanced generalization,\nachieving higher success rates: +9\\% in low traffic density, +21\\% in high\ntraffic density, and faster convergence with fewer training steps.

Sensor fusion\nbased on inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of accelerometers and\ngyroscopes is advantageous for reducing delays. The acceleration estimation\nenables the direct calculation of external forces. For serial robots, the\ninstallation of multiple accelerometers and gyroscopes is required for dynamics\nmodeling since the joint coordinates are the minimal coordinates.\nAlternatively, parallel robots (PRs) offer the potential to use only one IMU on\nthe end-effector platform, which already presents the minimal coordinates of\nthe PR. This work introduces a sensor-fusion method for contact detection using\nencoders and only one low-cost, consumer-grade IMU for a PR. The end-effector\naccelerations are estimated by an extended Kalman filter and incorporated into\nthe dynamics to calculate external forces. In real-world experiments with a\nplanar PR, we demonstrate that this approach reduces the detection duration by\nup to 50% compared to a momentum observer and enables the collision and\nclamping detection within 3-39ms.","main_category":"cs.RO","categories":"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY","published":"2025-05-13T08:24:57Z"}

We validate our method on brain\ninfarct and brain tumor segmentation, where our method outperforms current CNN\nand ViT-based models with a mean Dice score of 0.624 and 0.883 respectively.\nThese results highlight the efficacy of our design for better adaptability and\nperformance on tasks with real-world heterogeneous MR data.","main_category":"eess.IV","categories":"eess.IV,cs.CV","published":"2025-05-13T15:52:34Z"}

This energy, delivered over ~ 40 days via a quark-nova\n(QN) shock or the spin-down power of the HS, can reproduce the photometric and\nspectral features observed in SN 2023aew. In this model, the first light curve\npeak corresponds to the 56Ni-powered SN resulting from a stripped-envelope\nprogenitor with a zero-age main sequence mass of at least ~ (15-16)M_sun. The\nplateau between the two peaks may result from interaction between the SN ejecta\nand circumstellar material (CSM). Alternatively, it could be explained by the\nspin-down power of the NS prior to its conversion into a highly magnetized HS,\nwhich is responsible for powering the second bump. A scenario involving two\nphases of spin-down power - first from the NS and later from the HS - is\ncompelling and supports the hypothesis that some magnetars are, in fact, HSs.\nThese HSs acquire their ultra-strong magnetic fields through a quark matter\nphase capable of sustaining core fields on the order of ~ 1e18 G. In our model,\nthe spin-down energy of the HS powers the QN ejecta - the outermost layers of\nthe NS - before this energy is transferred to the expanded SN ejecta.

The origin of\nthese gamma-ray dark FXRTs and their connection to the diverse landscape of\nstellar explosions remains an open question, which can be tackled through the\nstudy of their multi-wavelength counterparts and environment.\n  In this paper, we present long-term radio observations of the gamma-ray dark\nEP241021a, which exhibits sustained radio emission for over 100 days, placing\nit among the longest-lived radio afterglows. We detect signature of\ninterstellar scintillation in early epochs, allowing us to constrain the\nangular size and Lorentz factor of the emitting region. Our observations point\nto an outflow that is at least mildly relativistic with Lorentz factor > 4.\nAfterglow modeling favors a moderately relativistic and collimated outflow\ninteracting with a low-density interstellar medium. The derived\nbeaming-corrected kinetic energy and low radiative efficiency are consistent\nwith a standard relativistic explosion which did not produce bright gamma-rays.\nAlternatively, a highly-relativistic structured jet remains consistent with our\nobservations if seen substantially off-axis. In the latter case, the initial\nX-ray flare detected by EP would be caused by the slower ejecta from the\nlateral wings intercepting our line of sight rather than by traditional\nprompt-emission mechanisms within the jet core.","main_category":"astro-ph.HE","categories":"astro-ph.HE","published":"2025-05-13T17:57:25Z"}
{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08784v1","title":"PCS-UQ: Uncertainty Quantification via the\n  Predictability-Computability-Stability Framework","summary":"As machine learning (ML) models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes\ndomains, trustworthy uncertainty quantification (UQ) is critical for ensuring\nthe safety and reliability of these models. Traditional UQ methods rely on\nspecifying a true generative model and are not robust to misspecification. On\nthe other hand, conformal inference allows for arbitrary ML models but does not\nconsider model selection, which leads to large interval sizes. We tackle these\ndrawbacks by proposing a UQ method based on the predictability, computability,\nand stability (PCS) framework for veridical data science proposed by Yu and\nKumbier. Specifically, PCS-UQ addresses model selection by using a prediction\ncheck to screen out unsuitable models. PCS-UQ then fits these screened\nalgorithms across multiple bootstraps to assess inter-sample variability and\nalgorithmic instability, enabling more reliable uncertainty estimates. Further,\nwe propose a novel calibration scheme that improves local adaptivity of our\nprediction sets. Experiments across $17$ regression and $6$ classification\ndatasets show that PCS-UQ achieves the desired coverage and reduces width over\nconformal approaches by $\\approx 20\\%$. Further, our local analysis shows\nPCS-UQ often achieves target coverage across subgroups while conformal methods\nfail to do so. For large deep-learning models, we propose computationally\nefficient approximation schemes that avoid the expensive multiple bootstrap\ntrainings of PCS-UQ. Across three computer vision benchmarks, PCS-UQ reduces\nprediction set size over conformal methods by $20\\%$. Theoretically, we show a\nmodified PCS-UQ algorithm is a form of split conformal inference and achieves\nthe desired coverage with exchangeable data.","main_category":"stat.ML","categories":"stat.ML,cs.LG,math.ST,stat.ME,stat.TH","published":"2025-05-13T17:58:16Z"}
{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08785v1","title":"Divisible and indivisible Stochastic-Quantum dynamics","summary":"This work presents a complete geometrical characterisation of divisible and\nindivisible time-evolution at the level of probabilities for systems with two\nconfigurations, open or closed. Our new geometrical construction in the space\nof stochastic matrices shows the existence of conical bounds separating\ndivisible and indivisible dynamics, bearing analogy with the relativistic\ncausal structure, with an emerging time pointing towards information erasure\nwhen the dynamics are divisible. Indivisible dynamics, which include quantum\ndynamics, are characterised by a time-flow against the information-erasure time\ncoordinate or by being tachyonic with respect to the cones in the stochastic\nmatrix space. This provides a geometric counterpart of other results in the\nliterature, such as the equivalence between information-decreasing and\ndivisible processes. The results apply under minimal assumptions: (i) the\nsystem has two configurations, (ii) one can freely ascribe initial\nprobabilities to both and (iii) probabilities at other times are linearly\nrelated to the initial ones through conditional probabilities. The optional\nassumption of (iv) continuity places further constraints on the system,\nremoving one of the past cones. Discontinuous stochastic dynamics in continuous\ntime include cases with divisible blocks of evolution which are not themselves\ndivisible. We show that the connection between continuity and multiplicity of\ndivisors holds for any dimension. We extend methods of coarse graining and\ndilations by incorporating dynamics and uncertainty, connecting them with\ndivisibility criteria. This is a first step towards a full geometric\ncharacterisation of indivisible stochastic dynamics for any number of\nconfigurations which, as they cannot at the level of probabilities be reduced\nto a composition of evolution operators, constitute fundamental elements of\nprobabilistic time-evolution.","main_category":"quant-ph","categories":"quant-ph,physics.data-an","published":"2025-05-13T17:58:56Z"}
