However, the presence of poor quality fundus images caused by factors\nsuch as inadequate illumination, noise, blurring and other motion artifacts\nyields a significant challenge for accurate DR screening. In this study, we\npropose progressive transfer learning for multi pass restoration to iteratively\nenhance the quality of degraded fundus images, ensuring more reliable DR\nscreening. Unlike previous methods that often focus on a single pass\nrestoration, multi pass restoration via PTL can achieve a superior blind\nrestoration performance that can even improve most of the good quality fundus\nimages in the dataset. Initially, a Cycle GAN model is trained to restore low\nquality images, followed by PTL induced restoration passes over the latest\nrestored outputs to improve overall quality in each pass. The proposed method\ncan learn blind restoration without requiring any paired data while surpassing\nits limitations by leveraging progressive learning and fine tuning strategies\nto minimize distortions and preserve critical retinal features. To evaluate\nPTL's effectiveness on multi pass restoration, we conducted experiments on\nDeepDRiD, a large scale fundus imaging dataset specifically curated for\ndiabetic retinopathy detection.

In this paper, we assess the impact of LLM interactions on software\nengineers' emotional responses, specifically strains, and identify common\ncauses of frustration when interacting with LLMs at work. Based on 62 survey\nresponses from software engineers in industry and academia across various\ncompanies and universities, we found that a majority of our respondents\nexperience frustrations or other related emotions regardless of the nature of\ntheir work. Additionally, our results showed that frustration mainly stemmed\nfrom issues with correctness and less critical issues such as adaptability to\ncontext or specific format. While such issues may not cause frustration in\ngeneral, artefacts that do not follow certain preferences, standards, or best\npractices can make the output unusable without extensive modification, causing\nfrustration over time.

However, existing editing techniques designed for diffusion\nmodels fail to translate directly to AR models due to fundamental differences\nin structural control. Specifically, AR models suffer from spatial poverty of\nattention maps and sequential accumulation of structural errors during image\nediting, which disrupt object layouts and global consistency. In this work, we\nintroduce Implicit Structure Locking (ISLock), the first training-free editing\nstrategy for AR visual models. Rather than relying on explicit attention\nmanipulation or fine-tuning, ISLock preserves structural blueprints by\ndynamically aligning self-attention patterns with reference images through the\nAnchor Token Matching (ATM) protocol. By implicitly enforcing structural\nconsistency in latent space, our method ISLock enables structure-aware editing\nwhile maintaining generative autonomy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nISLock achieves high-quality, structure-consistent edits without additional\ntraining and is superior or comparable to conventional editing techniques. Our\nfindings pioneer the way for efficient and flexible AR-based image editing,\nfurther bridging the performance gap between diffusion and autoregressive\ngenerative models.

This design includes\nFIFO's key features, such as read and write operations, full and empty flag\ngeneration, and pointer management for memory control. The FIFO was implemented\nusing Verilog to define the Register Transfer Level (RTL) design, ensuring\nfunctionality and timing requirements were met. For verification, three\napproaches were employed: (1) UVM-based Verification: A Universal Verification\nMethodology (UVM) testbench was developed to test the FIFO design rigorously.\nThe testbench includes components like interface, sequence item, driver,\nmonitor, scoreboard, agent, and environment. Directed and random tests were\nperformed to verify corner cases, such as simultaneous reads and writes, full\nand empty conditions, and overflow and underflow scenarios; (2) Traditional\nVerilog Testbench: A standalone Verilog testbench was also used to validate the\nfunctionality of the FIFO through directed test scenarios and waveform\nanalysis; (3) FPGA implementation: Additionally, the design was implemented on\nan FPGA for real-time testing to verify its functionality and timing behavior\nin hardware. FPGA-based verification ensured the design performed as expected\nunder practical conditions. The results confirmed the correct operation of the\nFIFO, including accurate data transfer, flag behavior, and timing\nsynchronization. The project successfully demonstrated the robustness and\nreliability of the synchronous FIFO design, highlighting its importance in\nmodern digital systems for efficient data handling and buffering.","main_category":"cs.CE","categories":"cs.CE","published":"2025-04-15T06:23:09Z"}

Despite its importance in real-life applications, this ability has\nnot been adequately investigated for state-of-the-art models. In this paper, we\nevaluate the cross-lingual context retrieval ability of over 40 LLMs across 12\nlanguages to understand the source of this ability, using cross-lingual machine\nreading comprehension (xMRC) as a representative scenario. Our results show\nthat several small, post-trained open LLMs show strong cross-lingual context\nretrieval ability, comparable to closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4o, and their\nestimated oracle performances greatly improve after post-training. Our\ninterpretability analysis shows that the cross-lingual context retrieval\nprocess can be divided into two main phases: question encoding and answer\nretrieval, which are formed in pre-training and post-training, respectively.\nThe phasing stability correlates with xMRC performance, and the xMRC bottleneck\nlies at the last model layers in the second phase, where the effect of\npost-training can be evidently observed. Our results also indicate that\nlarger-scale pretraining cannot improve the xMRC performance. Instead, larger\nLLMs need further multilingual post-training to fully unlock their\ncross-lingual context retrieval potential.

However, the mechanisms driving the\nevolution of cooperative behavior remain poorly understood, particularly in the\ncontext of simultaneous interactions involving multiple individuals, repeated\nencounters, and complex interaction structures. Here, we introduce a novel\nframework for studying repeated multi-player interactions in structured\npopulations -- repeated multi-player games on hypergraphs -- where multiple\nindividuals within each hyperedge engage in a repeated game, and each player\ncan simultaneously participate in many games. We focus on public goods games,\nwhere individuals differ in their initial endowments, their allocation of\nendowments across games, and their productivity, which determines the impact of\ntheir contributions. Through Nash equilibrium analysis, we reveal the intricate\ninterplay between full cooperation (all individuals contribute their entire\nendowments, maximizing collective benefits) and key factors such as initial\nendowments, productivity, contribution strategies, and interaction structure.\nNotably, while equal endowments are most effective in promoting full\ncooperation in homogeneous hypergraphs, they can hinder cooperation in\nheterogeneous hypergraphs, suggesting that equal endowments are not universally\noptimal. To address this, we propose two optimization strategies: one for\npolicymakers to adjust endowment distributions and another for players to\nmodify their contribution strategies. Both approaches successfully promote full\ncooperation across all studied hypergraphs. Our findings provide novel insights\ninto the emergence of full cooperation, offering valuable guidance for both\nplayers and policymakers in fostering collective cooperation.","main_category":"cs.GT","categories":"cs.GT","published":"2025-04-15T06:45:15Z"}

The pursuit here is of both effective and efficient\nsolutions to capture the partial correspondence between text queries and\nuntrimmed videos. Existing PRVR methods, which typically focus on modeling\nmulti-scale clip representations, however, suffer from content independence and\ninformation redundancy, impairing retrieval performance. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a simple yet effective approach with active moment\ndiscovering (AMDNet). We are committed to discovering video moments that are\nsemantically consistent with their queries. By using learnable span anchors to\ncapture distinct moments and applying masked multi-moment attention to\nemphasize salient moments while suppressing redundant backgrounds, we achieve\nmore compact and informative video representations. To further enhance moment\nmodeling, we introduce a moment diversity loss to encourage different moments\nof distinct regions and a moment relevance loss to promote semantically\nquery-relevant moments, which cooperate with a partially relevant retrieval\nloss for end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on two large-scale\nvideo datasets (\\ie, TVR and ActivityNet Captions) demonstrate the superiority\nand efficiency of our AMDNet.

Thus,\ngeodesic regression emerged as an extension where the response variable lives\non a Riemannian manifold. The parameters of geodesic regression, as with linear\nregression, capture the relationship of sensitive data and hence one should\nconsider the privacy protection practices of said parameters. We consider\nreleasing Differentially Private (DP) parameters of geodesic regression via the\nK-Norm Gradient (KNG) mechanism for Riemannian manifolds. We derive theoretical\nbounds for the sensitivity of the parameters showing they are tied to their\nrespective Jacobi fields and hence the curvature of the space. This\ncorroborates recent findings of differential privacy for the Fr\\'echet mean. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our methodology on the sphere,\n$\\mbS^2\\subset\\mbR^3$ and, since it is general to Riemannian manifolds, the\nmanifold of Euclidean space which simplifies geodesic regression to a case of\nlinear regression. Our methodology is general to any Riemannian manifold and\nthus it is suitable for data in domains such as medical imaging and computer\nvision.","main_category":"stat.ML","categories":"stat.ML,cs.LG","published":"2025-04-15T15:45:48Z"}

They exhibit exceptional strength-ductility\ntrade-offs in metallurgy (4-10) and near-continuum adsorbate binding energies\nin catalysis (11-16). A deep understanding of crystal nucleation and growth in\nHEAs is essential for controlling their formation and optimizing their\nstructural and functional properties. However, atomic-scale nucleation in HEAs\nchallenges traditional theories based on one or two principal elements (17-23).\nThe intricate interplay of structural and chemical orders among multiple\nprincipal elements further obscures our understanding of nucleation pathways\n(5,24-27). Due to the lack of direct three-dimensional (3D) atomic-scale\nobservations, previous studies have relied on simulations and indirect\nmeasurements (28-32), leaving HEA nucleation and growth fundamentally elusive.\nHere, we advance atomic electron tomography (33,34) to resolve the 3D atomic\nstructure and chemical composition of 7,662 HEA and 498 medium-entropy alloy\nnuclei at different nucleation stages. We observe local structural order that\ndecreases from core to boundary, correlating with local chemical order. As\nnuclei grow, structural order improves. At later stages, most nuclei coalesce\nwithout misorientation, while some form coherent twin boundaries. To explain\nthese experimental observations, we propose the gradient nucleation pathways\nmodel, in which the nucleation energy barrier progressively increases through\nmultiple evolving intermediate states. We expect these findings to not only\nprovide fundamental insights into crystal nucleation and growth in HEAs, but\nalso offer a general framework for understanding nucleation mechanisms in other\nmaterials.","main_category":"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","categories":"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.soft","published":"2025-04-15T16:02:40Z"}

We propose a novel Gaussian human avatar\nrepresentation that can reconstruct high-fidelity pose-dependence appearance\nwith details and meanwhile can be rendered in real time. Our Gaussian avatar is\nempowered by spatially distributed MLPs which are explicitly located on\ndifferent positions on human body. The parameters stored in each Gaussian are\nobtained by interpolating from the outputs of its nearby MLPs based on their\ndistances. To avoid undesired smooth Gaussian property changing during\ninterpolation, for each Gaussian we define a set of Gaussian offset basis, and\na linear combination of basis represents the Gaussian property offsets relative\nto the neutral properties. Then we propose to let the MLPs output a set of\ncoefficients corresponding to the basis. In this way, although Gaussian\ncoefficients are derived from interpolation and change smoothly, the Gaussian\noffset basis is learned freely without constraints. The smoothly varying\ncoefficients combined with freely learned basis can still produce distinctly\ndifferent Gaussian property offsets, allowing the ability to learn\nhigh-frequency spatial signals.

Specifically, CRAVE introduces a three-module\nframework. Ambiguity Elimination enchanced Evidence Retrieval module performs\nambiguity elimination and entity-based search to gather relevant evidence\nrelated to claim verification from external sources like Wikipedia.

Applied to a dataset of 260 soluble proteins, this\nyields an average density of 1.296 g cm-3, notably lower than the widely cited\nvalue of 1.35 g cm-3. Contrary to previous suggestions, we find no correlation\nbetween protein density and molecular weight.

To study the structure of TOI-2109b's atmosphere, we obtained\nhigh-resolution emission spectra of both the planetary day- and nightsides with\nCARMENES and CRIRES$^+$. By applying the cross-correlation technique, we\nidentified the emission signatures of Fe I and CO, as well as a thermal\ninversion layer in the dayside atmosphere; no significant H$_2$O signal was\ndetected from the dayside. None of the analyzed species were detectable from\nthe nightside atmosphere.

The dayside thermal inversion extends from 3200 K to 4600\nK, with an atmospheric metallicity consistent with that of the host star (0.36\ndex). Only weak constraints could be placed on the C/O ratio ($>$ 0.15).

The Abstraction and Reasoning\nCorpus (ARC) benchmark plays a crucial role in evaluating these capabilities by\ntesting how well AI models generalize to novel problems. While GPT-4o\ndemonstrates strong performance by solving all ARC tasks under zero-noise\nconditions, other models like DeepSeek R1 and LLaMA 3.2 fail to solve any,\nsuggesting limitations in their ability to reason beyond simple pattern\nmatching. To explore this gap, we systematically evaluate these models across\ndifferent noise levels and temperature settings. Our results reveal that the\nintroduction of noise consistently impairs model performance, regardless of\narchitecture. This decline highlights a shared vulnerability: current LLMs,\ndespite showing signs of abstract reasoning, remain highly sensitive to input\nperturbations. Such fragility raises concerns about their real-world\napplicability, where noise and uncertainty are common. By comparing how\ndifferent model architectures respond to these challenges, we offer insights\ninto the structural weaknesses of modern LLMs in reasoning tasks.

The origin of the\nUV emission in these Blue excess Hot DOGs (BHDs) has been linked to scattered\nlight from the central engine. Here we study the properties of the UV emission\nin the BHD WISE J020446.13-050640.8 (W0204-0506).

These models rely on iterative message passing to propagate node\nfeatures, enabling nodes to aggregate information from their neighbors. Recent\nresearch has significantly improved the message-passing mechanism, enhancing\nGNN scalability on large-scale graphs. However, GNNs still face two main\nchallenges: over-smoothing, where excessive message passing results in\nindistinguishable node representations, especially in deep networks\nincorporating high-order neighbors; and scalability issues, as traditional\narchitectures suffer from high model complexity and increased inference time\ndue to redundant information aggregation. This paper proposes a novel framework\nfor large-scale graphs named ScaleGNN that simultaneously addresses both\nchallenges by adaptively fusing multi-level graph features. We first construct\nneighbor matrices for each order, learning their relative information through\ntrainable weights through an adaptive high-order feature fusion module. This\nallows the model to selectively emphasize informative high-order neighbors\nwhile reducing unnecessary computational costs. Additionally, we introduce a\nHigh-order redundant feature masking mechanism based on a Local Contribution\nScore (LCS), which enables the model to retain only the most relevant neighbors\nat each order, preventing redundant information propagation. Furthermore,\nlow-order enhanced feature aggregation adaptively integrates low-order and\nhigh-order features based on task relevance, ensuring effective capture of both\nlocal and global structural information without excessive complexity.

Most existing video\nunderstanding models work well on short videos of pre-segmented events, yet\nthey struggle to summarise longer videos where relevant events are sparsely\ndistributed and not pre-segmented. Moreover, long-form video understanding\noften relies on supervised hierarchical training that needs extensive\nannotations which are costly, slow and prone to inconsistency. With ViSMaP we\nbridge the gap between short videos (where annotated data is plentiful) and\nlong ones (where it's not). We rely on LLMs to create optimised\npseudo-summaries of long videos using segment descriptions from short ones.\nThese pseudo-summaries are used as training data for a model that generates\nlong-form video summaries, bypassing the need for expensive annotations of long\nvideos. Specifically, we adopt a meta-prompting strategy to iteratively\ngenerate and refine creating pseudo-summaries of long videos. The strategy\nleverages short clip descriptions obtained from a supervised short video model\nto guide the summary. Each iteration uses three LLMs working in sequence: one\nto generate the pseudo-summary from clip descriptions, another to evaluate it,\nand a third to optimise the prompt of the generator. This iteration is\nnecessary because the quality of the pseudo-summaries is highly dependent on\nthe generator prompt, and varies widely among videos.

RL for LLMs involves two stages: generation and\ntraining. The LLM first generates samples online, which are then used to derive\nrewards for training. The conventional view holds that the colocated\narchitecture, where the two stages share resources via temporal multiplexing,\noutperforms the disaggregated architecture, in which dedicated resources are\nassigned to each stage. However, in real-world deployments, we observe that the\ncolocated architecture suffers from resource coupling, where the two stages are\nconstrained to use the same resources. This coupling compromises the\nscalability and cost-efficiency of colocated RL in large-scale training. In\ncontrast, the disaggregated architecture allows for flexible resource\nallocation, supports heterogeneous training setups, and facilitates\ncross-datacenter deployment.\n  StreamRL is designed with disaggregation from first principles and fully\nunlocks its potential by addressing two types of performance bottlenecks in\nexisting disaggregated RL frameworks: pipeline bubbles, caused by stage\ndependencies, and skewness bubbles, resulting from long-tail output length\ndistributions. To address pipeline bubbles, StreamRL breaks the traditional\nstage boundary in synchronous RL algorithms through stream generation and\nachieves full overlapping in asynchronous RL. To address skewness bubbles,\nStreamRL employs an output-length ranker model to identify long-tail samples\nand reduces generation time via skewness-aware dispatching and scheduling.\nExperiments show that StreamRL improves throughput by up to 2.66x compared to\nexisting state-of-the-art systems, and improves cost-effectiveness by up to\n1.33x in a heterogeneous, cross-datacenter setting.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,cs.DC","published":"2025-04-22T14:19:06Z"}

However,\ndespite their efficiency in handling long contexts, recent studies have shown\nthat SSMs, such as Mamba models, generally underperform compared to\nTransformers in long-context understanding tasks. To address this significant\nshortfall and achieve both efficient and accurate long-context understanding,\nwe propose LongMamba, a training-free technique that significantly enhances the\nlong-context capabilities of Mamba models. LongMamba builds on our discovery\nthat the hidden channels in Mamba can be categorized into local and global\nchannels based on their receptive field lengths, with global channels primarily\nresponsible for long-context capability. These global channels can become the\nkey bottleneck as the input context lengthens. Specifically, when input lengths\nlargely exceed the training sequence length, global channels exhibit\nlimitations in adaptively extend their receptive fields, leading to Mamba's\npoor long-context performance. The key idea of LongMamba is to mitigate the\nhidden state memory decay in these global channels by preventing the\naccumulation of unimportant tokens in their memory. This is achieved by first\nidentifying critical tokens in the global channels and then applying token\nfiltering to accumulate only those critical tokens. Through extensive\nbenchmarking across synthetic and real-world long-context scenarios, LongMamba\nsets a new standard for Mamba's long-context performance, significantly\nextending its operational range without requiring additional training.

Extracting observables\nin these regimes is a notoriously difficult program as quantum randomness makes\nthem fully probabilistic. However, among all the possible quantum histories,\nthe ones which are relevant for Cosmology are conditioned by the requirement\nthat stochastic inflation ended. From an observational point of view, it would\nbe more convenient to model stochastic periods as starting from the time at\nwhich they ended and evolving backwards in times. We present a time-reversed\napproach to stochastic inflation, based on a reverse Fokker-Planck equation,\nwhich allows us to derive non-perturbatively the probability distribution of\nthe field values at a given time before the end of the quantum regime. As a\nmotivated example, we solve the flat semi-infinite potential and derive a new\nand exact formula for the probability distribution of the quantum-generated\ncurvature fluctuations. It is normalisable while exhibiting tails slowly\ndecaying as a Levy distribution.

However,\nconstruction sites present significant challenges for traditional tracking\nmethods due to featureless surfaces, dynamic changes, and drift accumulation,\nleading to misalignment between digital models and the physical world. This\npaper proposes a BIM-aware drift correction method to address these challenges.\nInstead of relying solely on SLAM-based localization, we align ``as-built\"\ndetected planes from the real-world environment with ``as-planned\"\narchitectural planes in BIM. Our method performs robust plane matching and\ncomputes a transformation (TF) between SLAM (S) and BIM (B) origin frames using\noptimization techniques, minimizing drift over time. By incorporating BIM as\nprior structural knowledge, we can achieve improved long-term localization and\nenhanced AR visualization accuracy in noisy construction environments.

To address\nthis, we present Token-Shuffle, a novel yet simple method that reduces the\nnumber of image tokens in Transformer. Our key insight is the dimensional\nredundancy of visual vocabularies in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),\nwhere low-dimensional visual codes from visual encoder are directly mapped to\nhigh-dimensional language vocabularies. Leveraging this, we consider two key\noperations: token-shuffle, which merges spatially local tokens along channel\ndimension to decrease the input token number, and token-unshuffle, which\nuntangles the inferred tokens after Transformer blocks to restore the spatial\narrangement for output. Jointly training with textual prompts, our strategy\nrequires no additional pretrained text-encoder and enables MLLMs to support\nextremely high-resolution image synthesis in a unified next-token prediction\nway while maintaining efficient training and inference.

Recent work on reconstructing\nthe 3D human body using 3DGS attempts to leverage prior information on human\npose to enhance rendering quality and improve training speed. However, it\nstruggles to effectively fit dynamic surface planes due to multi-view\ninconsistency and redundant Gaussians.

To\naddress these, we propose EfficientHuman, a model that quickly accomplishes the\ndynamic reconstruction of the human body using Articulated 2D Gaussian while\nensuring high rendering quality. The key innovation involves encoding Gaussian\nsplats as Articulated 2D Gaussian surfels in canonical space and then\ntransforming them to pose space via Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) to achieve\nefficient pose transformations.

In this paper, we\nintroduce a secure and robust encryption scheme that is multi-modality\ncompatible and works with MRI, CT, X-Ray and Ultrasound images for different\nanatomical region of interest. The method utilizes hyperchaotic signals and\nmulti-level diffusion methods. The encryption starts by taking DICOM image as\ninput, then padding to increase the image area. Chaotic signals are produced by\na logistic map and are used to carry out pixel random permutation. Then,\nmulti-level diffusion is carried out by 4-bit, 8-bit, radial and adjacent\ndiffusion to provide high randomness and immunity against statistical attacks.\nIn addition, we propose a captcha-based authentication scheme to further\nimprove security. An algorithm generates alphanumeric captcha-based image which\nis encrypted with the same chaotic and diffusion methods as the medical image.\nBoth encrypted images(DICOM image and captcha image) are then superimposed to\ncreate a final encrypted output, essentially integrating dual-layer security.\nUpon decryption, the superimposed image is again decomposed back to original\nmedical and captcha images, and inverse operations are performed to obtain the\noriginal unencrypted data. Experimental results show that the proposed method\nprovides strong protection with no loss in image integrity, thereby reducing\nunauthorized data breaches to a significant level.

In addition to its\nsimple implementation, recent studies have revealed that its error and cost can\nbe reduced if the initial state is closed in the low-energy subspace. However,\nthe improvement by the low-energy property rapidly vanishes as the Trotter\norder grows in the previous studies, and thus, it is mysterious whether there\nexists genuine advantage of low-energy initial states. In this Letter, we\nresolve this problem by proving the optimal error bound and cost of\nTrotterization for low-energy initial states. For generic local Hamiltonians\ncomposed of positive-semidefinite terms, we show that the Trotter error is at\nmost linear in the initial state energy $\\Delta$ and polylogarithmic in the\nsystem size $N$.

For this, we\nintroduce an adaptive LDP mechanism called Bipartite Randomized Response (BRR),\nwhich solves the above privacy-utility maximization problem from the global\nstandpoint. We prove that for any utility function and any privacy level,\nsolving the maximization problem is equivalent to confirming how many\nhigh-utility data to be treated equally as the true data on release\nprobability, the outcome of which gives the optimal randomized response.\nFurther, solving this linear program can be computationally cheap in theory.\nSeveral examples of utility functions defined by distance metrics and\napplications in decision trees and deep learning are presented. The results of\nvarious experiments show that our BRR significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art LDP mechanisms of both continuous and distributed types.","main_category":"cs.CR","categories":"cs.CR","published":"2025-04-29T16:39:50Z"}

While achieving the\ndissipation-less Frohlich current of the sliding condensate is impossible in\nreal materials, one can imagine an important related target, namely reaching\nthe electron transport regime where electronic noise is inhibited due to the\ncollective, strongly-correlated nature of the electron-lattice condensate\ncurrent. Here we report that in nanowires of the fully-gapped CDW material\n(TaSe4)2I, low-frequency electronic noise is suppressed below the limit of\nthermalized charge carriers in passive resistors. When the current is dominated\nby the sliding Frohlich condensate, the normalized noise spectral density\ndecreases linearly with current -- a striking departure from the constant value\nobserved in conventional conductors. This discovery signals intrinsically lower\ncurrent fluctuations within a correlated transport regime. The dominant noise\nsource due to fluctuations in the CDW depinning threshold is extrinsic and\ncaused by lattice imperfections that locally pin the condensate.

Then we conducted multivariate regression analysis to\nexplore the impact of the model's ability to predict demographics on its\nscoring outcomes.

Thus, scalable methods for crystal symmetry\ndetermination that can analyze a large volume of material samples within a\nshort time-frame are especially needed.

Methods: We obtained 938 low-dose CT scans from the National Lung\nScreening Trial with 1,246 nodules and semantic features.

By transferring part of the\nconstraint-checking process from the planning phase to the execution phase,\nLLM-PAS enables exploration of the constraint space and delivers more accurate\nfeedback on environmental anomalies during execution. The reasoning\ncapabilities of the LLM allow it to handle anomalies that cannot be addressed\nby the robust executor. To further enhance the system's ability to assist the\nplanner during replanning, we propose the First Look Prompting (FLP) method,\nwhich induces LLM to generate effective PDDL goals. Through comparative\nprompting experiments and systematic experiments, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness and robustness of LLM-PAS in handling anomalous conditions during\ntask execution.","main_category":"cs.RO","categories":"cs.RO,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-30T12:53:53Z"}

We apply structured pruning with\ndomain-specific constraints, ensuring that the resulting pruned models retain\nessential knowledge for the target domain. To further enhance performance,\nthese pruned models undergo self-data distillation, leveraging SAE-curated\ndatasets to restore key domain-specific information lost during pruning.\nExtensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that FineScope achieves\nhighly competitive performance, outperforming several large-scale\nstate-of-the-art LLMs in domain-specific tasks.

Traditional approaches, such as crisp clustering, rely on\nthe assumption that clusters are sufficiently separated with little overlap.\nHowever, real-world data often defy this assumption, exhibiting overlapping\ndistributions or overlapping clouds of points and blurred boundaries between\nclusters. Fuzzy clustering offers a compelling alternative by allowing partial\nmembership in multiple clusters, making it well-suited for these ambiguous\nscenarios. Despite its advantages, current fuzzy clustering methods primarily\nfocus on univariate time series, and for multivariate cases, even datasets of\nmoderate dimensionality become computationally prohibitive. This challenge is\nfurther exacerbated when dealing with time series of varying lengths, leaving a\nclear gap in addressing the complexities of modern datasets. This work\nintroduces a novel fuzzy clustering approach based on common principal\ncomponent analysis to address the aforementioned shortcomings. Our method has\nthe advantage of efficiently handling high-dimensional multivariate time series\nby reducing dimensionality while preserving critical temporal features.\nExtensive numerical results show that our proposed clustering method\noutperforms several existing approaches in the literature.

A common approach is to repeatedly prune and then\nfine-tune, with increasing amounts of model parameters being removed in each\nstep. While straightforward to implement, pruning pipelines that follow this\napproach are computationally expensive due to the need for repeated\nfine-tuning.\n  In this paper we propose ICE-Pruning, an iterative pruning pipeline for DNNs\nthat significantly decreases the time required for pruning by reducing the\noverall cost of fine-tuning, while maintaining a similar accuracy to existing\npruning pipelines. ICE-Pruning is based on three main components: i) an\nautomatic mechanism to determine after which pruning steps fine-tuning should\nbe performed; ii) a freezing strategy for faster fine-tuning in each pruning\nstep; and iii) a custom pruning-aware learning rate scheduler to further\nimprove the accuracy of each pruning step and reduce the overall time\nconsumption. We also propose an efficient auto-tuning stage for the\nhyperparameters (e.g., freezing percentage) introduced by the three components.\nWe evaluate ICE-Pruning on several DNN models and datasets, showing that it can\naccelerate pruning by up to 9.61x.

These include microsecond temporal resolution, robustness under\nvarying lighting conditions and low power consumption. Nevertheless, the\neffective processing of their sparse, asynchronous event streams remains\nchallenging. Existing approaches to this problem can be categorised into two\ndistinct groups. The first group involves the direct processing of event data\nwith neural models, such as Spiking Neural Networks or Graph Convolutional\nNeural Networks. However, this approach is often accompanied by a compromise in\nterms of qualitative performance. The second group involves the conversion of\nevents into dense representations with handcrafted aggregation functions, which\ncan boost accuracy at the cost of temporal fidelity. This paper introduces a\nnovel Self-Supervised Event Representation (SSER) method leveraging Gated\nRecurrent Unit (GRU) networks to achieve precise per-pixel encoding of event\ntimestamps and polarities without temporal discretisation. The recurrent layers\nare trained in a self-supervised manner to maximise the fidelity of event-time\nencoding. The inference is performed with event representations generated\nasynchronously, thus ensuring compatibility with high-throughput sensors. The\nexperimental validation demonstrates that SSER outperforms aggregation-based\nbaselines, achieving improvements of 2.4% mAP and 0.6% on the Gen1 and 1 Mpx\nobject detection datasets. Furthermore, the paper presents the first hardware\nimplementation of recurrent representation for event data on a System-on-Chip\nFPGA, achieving sub-microsecond latency and power consumption between 1-2 W,\nsuitable for real-time, power-efficient applications.

Among\nits strategies, pseudo-supervision has proven highly effective, typically\nrelying on one or multiple teacher networks to refine pseudo-labels before\ntraining a student network. A common practice in pseudo-supervision is\nfiltering pseudo-labels based on pre-defined confidence thresholds or entropy.\nHowever, selecting optimal thresholds requires large labeled datasets, which\nare often scarce in real-world semi-supervised scenarios. To overcome this\nchallenge, we propose Ensemble-of-Confidence Reinforcement (ENCORE), a dynamic\nfeedback-driven thresholding strategy for pseudo-label selection. Instead of\nrelying on static confidence thresholds, ENCORE estimates class-wise\ntrue-positive confidence within the unlabeled dataset and continuously adjusts\nthresholds based on the model's response to different levels of pseudo-label\nfiltering. This feedback-driven mechanism ensures the retention of informative\npseudo-labels while filtering unreliable ones, enhancing model training without\nmanual threshold tuning. Our method seamlessly integrates into existing\npseudo-supervision frameworks and significantly improves segmentation\nperformance, particularly in data-scarce conditions. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that integrating ENCORE with existing pseudo-supervision frameworks\nenhances performance across multiple datasets and network architectures,\nvalidating its effectiveness in semi-supervised learning.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-05-12T15:58:08Z"}

This work investigates the effect of luminosity\noutbursts on the abundance of pebbles and their ice mantles in protoplanetary\ndisks. We perform global simulations of formation and evolution of a\nself-gravitating viscous protoplanetary disk using the 2D hydrodynamic\nthin-disk FEOSAD code, which self-consistently reproduces luminosity outbursts.\nThe model includes thermal balance, dust evolution and its interaction with\ngas, development of magnetorotational instability, adsorption and desorption of\nfour volatile compounds (H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$ and CO), and the feedback of\nice mantles on dust fragmentation properties.

This is because the H$_2$O snowline falls\nwithin the viscous heating dominated region during early disk evolution stages,\nwhile snowlines of other molecules are located in regions dominated by stellar\nirradiation heating and are thus more sensitive to temperature changes during\noutbursts. Nevertheless, luminosity outbursts reduce the total amount of\npebbles in the disk by half due to destruction of dust aggregates into monomers\nfollowing the loss of water ice that binds the aggregates together. Pebble\nrecovery occurs over several thousand years after the outburst ends due to\ncollisional coagulation, with recovery timescales significantly exceeding water\nfreeze-out times. Ice mantle desorption occurs in a complex non-axisymmetric 2D\nregion of the disk, associated with spiral substructure formation during early\nevolution of gravitationally unstable disks.","main_category":"astro-ph.EP","categories":"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.SR","published":"2025-05-12T16:24:28Z"}

Recent advancements in event cameras have\nopened up new opportunities for addressing these challenges. While existing\nevent-based VFI methods have succeeded in recovering large and complex motions\nby leveraging handcrafted intermediate representations such as optical flow,\nthese designs often compromise high-fidelity image reconstruction under subtle\nmotion scenarios due to their reliance on explicit motion modeling. Meanwhile,\ndiffusion models provide a promising alternative for VFI by reconstructing\nframes through a denoising process, eliminating the need for explicit motion\nestimation or warping operations. In this work, we propose EventDiff, a unified\nand efficient event-based diffusion model framework for VFI. EventDiff features\na novel Event-Frame Hybrid AutoEncoder (HAE) equipped with a lightweight\nSpatial-Temporal Cross Attention (STCA) module that effectively fuses dynamic\nevent streams with static frames. Unlike previous event-based VFI methods,\nEventDiff performs interpolation directly in the latent space via a denoising\ndiffusion process, making it more robust across diverse and challenging VFI\nscenarios. Through a two-stage training strategy that first pretrains the HAE\nand then jointly optimizes it with the diffusion model, our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple synthetic and real-world event VFI\ndatasets. The proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art event-based\nVFI methods by up to 1.98dB in PSNR on Vimeo90K-Triplet and shows superior\nperformance in SNU-FILM tasks with multiple difficulty levels.

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08358v1","title":"What can solve the Strong CP problem?","summary":"Three possible strategies have been advocated to solve the strong CP problem.\nThe first is the axion, a dynamical mechanism that relaxes any initial value of\nthe CP violating angle $\\bar{\\theta}$ to zero. The second is the imposition of\nnew symmetries that are believed to set $\\bar{\\theta}$ to zero in the UV. The\nthird is the acceptance of the fine tuning of parameters. We argue that the\nlatter two solutions do not solve the strong CP problem. The $\\theta$ term of\nQCD is not a parameter - it does not exist in the Hamiltonian. Rather, it is a\nproperty of the quantum state that our universe finds itself in, arising from\nthe fact that there are CP violating states of a CP preserving Hamiltonian. It\nis not eliminated by imposing parity as a symmetry since the underlying theory\nis already parity symmetric and that does not preclude the existence of CP\nviolating states. Moreover, since the value of $\\theta$ realized in our\nuniverse is a consequence of measurement, it is inherently random and cannot be\nfine tuned by choice of parameters. Rather any fine tuning would require a\ntuning between parameters in the theory and the random outcome of measurement.\nOur results considerably strengthen the case for the existence of the axion and\naxion dark matter. The confusion around $\\theta$ arises from the fact that\nunlike classical mechanics, the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian are not equivalent\nin quantum mechanics. The Hamiltonian defines the differential time evolution,\nwhereas the Lagrangian is a solution to this evolution. Consequently, initial\nconditions could in principle appear in the Lagrangian but not in the\nHamiltonian. This results in aspects of the initial condition such as $\\theta$\nmisleadingly appearing in the Lagrangian as parameters. We comment on the\nsimilarity between the $\\theta$ vacua and the violations of the constraint\nequations of classical gauge theories in quantum mechanics.","main_category":"hep-ph","categories":"hep-ph,hep-th","published":"2025-05-13T09:06:21Z"}

Using the Breuer-Piilo-Laine (BLP)\nmeasure, we show that for Gaussian states, squeezing and thermal fluctuations\ndo not enhance non-Markovianity.

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08770v1","title":"Analytically tractable reconstruction of singular hyperbolic and\n  quasi-strange attractors of Lorenz-type systems","summary":"We consider a certain three-dimensional piecewise linear system of Lorenz\ntype in the cases of positive and negative saddle value, which is the sum of\ntwo eigenvalues of the saddle nearest to zero. This system was recently\nproposed and studied in \\cite{belykh2019lorenz} for the case of the positive\nsaddle value. Here we consider the main bifurcations leading to the birth of\nthe strange attractor and provide its comparison with those of original smooth\nLorenz model. For the case of a negative saddle value, we obtain an explicit\nforms of homoclinic and pitchfork bifurcations forming a codimension 1 cascade\nleading to the emergence of a quasi-strange attractor. This cascade reproduces\na typical bifurcation route towards the birth of a quasi-strange attractor in\nsmooth Lorenz-like systems with the negative saddle value. We support our\nanalytical result with a numerical comparison with the Lorenz-Lyubimov-Zaks\nsystem.","main_category":"math.DS","categories":"math.DS","published":"2025-05-13T17:49:38Z"}

HealthBench consists of\n5,000 multi-turn conversations between a model and an individual user or\nhealthcare professional. Responses are evaluated using conversation-specific\nrubrics created by 262 physicians. Unlike previous multiple-choice or\nshort-answer benchmarks, HealthBench enables realistic, open-ended evaluation\nthrough 48,562 unique rubric criteria spanning several health contexts (e.g.,\nemergencies, transforming clinical data, global health) and behavioral\ndimensions (e.g., accuracy, instruction following, communication). HealthBench\nperformance over the last two years reflects steady initial progress (compare\nGPT-3.5 Turbo's 16% to GPT-4o's 32%) and more rapid recent improvements (o3\nscores 60%). Smaller models have especially improved: GPT-4.1 nano outperforms\nGPT-4o and is 25 times cheaper. We additionally release two HealthBench\nvariations: HealthBench Consensus, which includes 34 particularly important\ndimensions of model behavior validated via physician consensus, and HealthBench\nHard, where the current top score is 32%. We hope that HealthBench grounds\nprogress towards model development and applications that benefit human health.","main_category":"cs.CL","categories":"cs.CL","published":"2025-05-13T17:53:59Z"}

While ARC-AGI remains very challenging for artificial intelligence\nsystems, it is rather easy for humans. This paper introduces ARC-NCA, a\ndevelopmental approach leveraging standard Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and\nNCA enhanced with hidden memories (EngramNCA) to tackle the ARC-AGI benchmark.\nNCAs are employed for their inherent ability to simulate complex dynamics and\nemergent patterns, mimicking developmental processes observed in biological\nsystems. Developmental solutions may offer a promising avenue for enhancing\nAI's problem-solving capabilities beyond mere training data extrapolation.\nARC-NCA demonstrates how integrating developmental principles into\ncomputational models can foster adaptive reasoning and abstraction. We show\nthat our ARC-NCA proof-of-concept results may be comparable to, and sometimes\nsurpass, that of ChatGPT 4.5, at a fraction of the cost.","main_category":"cs.AI","categories":"cs.AI,cs.NE","published":"2025-05-13T17:55:43Z"}

To\naddress the inherent challenges of precoding in such distributed systems,\nrecent studies have explored the use of graph neural network (GNN)-based\nmethods, using their powerful representation capabilities. However, these\napproaches have predominantly been trained and validated on synthetic datasets,\nleaving their generalizability to real-world propagation environments largely\nunverified. In this work, we initially pre-train the GNN using simulated\nchannel state information (CSI) data, which incorporates standard propagation\nmodels and small-scale Rayleigh fading. Subsequently, we finetune the model on\nreal-world CSI measurements collected from a physical testbed equipped with\ndistributed access points (APs). To balance the retention of pre-trained\nfeatures with adaptation to real-world conditions, we adopt a layer-freezing\nstrategy during fine-tuning, wherein several GNN layers are frozen and only the\nlater layers remain trainable. Numerical results demonstrate that the\nfine-tuned GNN significantly outperforms the pre-trained model, achieving an\napproximate 8.2 bits per channel use gain at 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),\ncorresponding to a 15.7 % improvement. These findings highlight the critical\nrole of transfer learning and underscore the potential of GNN-based precoding\ntechniques to effectively generalize from synthetic to real-world wireless\nenvironments.","main_category":"eess.SP","categories":"eess.SP","published":"2025-05-13T17:59:47Z"}
